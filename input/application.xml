			<section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">
				The scope of this Protection Profile is to describe the
				functionality of application software in terms of
				<cite linkend="bibCC" />
				and to define functional and assurance requirements for such
				software. In recent years, software attacks have shifted from
				targeting operating systems to targeting applications. This has been
				the natural response to improvements in operating system security
				and development processes. As a result, it is paramount that the
				security of applications be improved to reduce the risk to client
				machines and enterprise networks. The requirements in this
				Protection Profile are intended to improve the security of
				applications by ensuring that they take advantage of operating
				system security services, environmental mitigations, and underlying
				hardware. Additionally, these requirements attempt to define
				acceptable behavior for applications regardless of the security
				features provided by the operating system.
			</section>
			<section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
				The requirements in this document apply to all application software
				that runs on any operating system -- regardless of the function of
				the application, identity of the operating system, or composition of
				the underlying platform. For purposes of this document, an
				application is defined as software that runs on an operating system
				and performs tasks on behalf of the user or owner of the platform.
				As distinguished from applications, operating system software
				manages platform resources and provides services for applications.
				Applications that come bundled with an operating system (such as web
				browsers, email clients and media players) fall within the scope of
				these requirements. Naturally, third-party software (such as word
				processors, PDF readers, and downloadable smart-phone apps) is also
				in scope. Systems software that is delivered and installed with an
				application (such as kernel drivers) is considered part of the
				application for purposes of this document. BIOS and other firmware,
				the operating system kernel, and other systems software (and
				drivers) that are essential to the functioning of the system are
				outside the scope of this document. System services -- even if they
				run with user-level privileges -- are considered to be part of the
				operating system, and are thus also out of scope. Some application
				types are covered by more specific protection profiles. Such
				applications are subject to both this Protection Profile (PP) and
				the PP that addresses their special functionality. For example, VPN
				Client Applications are subject to the requirements in both this PP
				and the VPN Client PP.

					While biometric verification systems solve some of the problems

					technology leads to some specific vulnerabilities that are inherent
					for this kind of technology. As such each evaluation of a biometric
					system will have to consider those vulnerabilities like the use of
					fakes or the imitation of biometric characteristics. Some of those
					vulnerabilities are addressed by the description of the threats in
					this PP. In the context of this PP the evaluator should seek their
					primary guidance for vulnerability assessment in public sources
					listing typical vulnerabilities of biometric technology. Those
					sources should include (but not be limited to)
					<cite linkend="bibISO19792" />

			<description>Ensure the integrity of application installation and
				update packages.
			 Software is seldom (if
				ever) shipped without latent errors and vulnerabilities. The ability
				to deploy patches and updates to fielded software is critical to
				enterprise network security.				Exploitation of vulnerabilities in application software is currently
				one of the chief paths by which attackers gain control of target
				computers. In recent years, processor manufacturers, compiler
				developers, and operating system vendors have developed execution
				environment-based mitigations that increase the cost to the
				adversary by adding complexity to the task of gaining execution.
				Often, developers can easily take advantage of these mechanisms by
				using an API provided by the operating system, or by enabling the
				mechanism through compiler or linker options. The following are
				examples of execution environment mitigations:
				<ul>
					<li>Address-space layout randomization provides a mechanism that
						randomizes the addresses at which binary images as well as any
						runtime storage (such as heaps and stacks), are loaded in memory.
						Varying the locations of all memory mappings adds complexity to
						the job of an attacker by reducing the predictability of memory
						layout. The effectiveness of address-space randomization is
						significantly reduced by the existence of any constant mappings.
					</li>
					<li>Memory execution protection (a.k.a. Data Execution Prevention
						(DEP)) provides a mechanism for terminating an application when
						code is executed from writable memory -- that is, memory intended
						for data only. This can severely limit the places where an
						attacker can load arbitrary code into memory and attempt to run
						it.
					</li>
					<li>Stack buffer overflow protection provides a mechanism that
						terminates an application when a stack overflow is detected. The
						benefit of this mechanism is that the target application
						terminates before malicious code is able to execute.					</li>
					<li>Heap corruption protection provides a mechanism that terminates
						an application when heap structures or metadata corruption is
						detected.					</li>
				</ul>
				Other execution environment mitigations might include numeric
				overflow protections, automatic runtime bounds checking, supervisor
				mode execution protection, and strict type-checking for numeric
				comparisons.

			<description> An unmanageable network is much more difficult to
				secure than a manageable network. Identifying the software on a
				network is a major challenge to network management. This challenge
				can be addressed using software identification (SWID) tags. SWID
				tags are XML files embedded within software that provide a standard
				method for IT departments to track and manage software. The presence
				of SWIDs can greatly simplify the software management process and
				improve security by enhancing the ability of IT departments to
				manage updates.			

			Simplify the deployment of applications and application
				updates through the use of standard supported deployment mechanisms
				and formats.
			Ensure that applications use a standard mechanism for
				storing and setting configuration options.
			Ensure that all traces of applications are removed
				during the application removal operation. Exceptions to this are
				configuration and preference settings that would be useful in the
				event of reinstallation, and audit or log events produced by the
				application.
			Ensure that applications are configured in the most
				secure manner consistent with the intended use of the product in the

			<description> Modification of executable files is a common technique
				used by malware to gain persistence on a system. This risk can be
				mitigated by requiring that application data be written only to

				confined to directories that can be written only with administrator
				privilege. Application whitelisting is a technique for enforcing
				such policies through enumerating the individual applications that
				may be executed on a system, or by specifying the directories from
				which applications may be executed. Applications can support this
				model by writing data only to locations permitted by security
				policy. Applications should never write to their own installation
				directories, or to the installation directories of other
				applications. Even though these controls are implemented by the
				operating system, it is critical that applications conform to the
				policies these controls implement. If a business-critical
				application does not conform, then there will be pressure to create
				a policy exception for the application. This should never happen.
