    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">The scope of this Protection
    Profile (PP) is to describe the security functionality of application software in
    terms of 
    <cite linkend="bibCC" /> and to define functional and assurance requirements
    for such software. In recent years, software attacks have shifted from
    targeting operating systems to targeting applications. This has been the
    natural response to improvements in operating system security and
    development processes. As a result, it is paramount that the security of
    applications be improved to reduce the risk to client systems and
    enterprise networks.</section>

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">The
    requirements in this document apply to all application software that runs
    on any operating system regardless of the function of the application,
    identity of the operating system, or composition of the underlying hardware
    platform. This includes mobile applications as well as application
    software on desktop or server platforms. Some application types are covered
    by more specific PPs which may be expressed as Extended Packages of this
    PP. Such applications are subject to the requirements of both this PP and
    the Extended Package that addresses their special functionality. 
    For example, web browsers are subject to the requirements in this PP and the Extended Package for Web Browsers 
    (Note: version 1.0 for web browsers is formally categorized as a Protection Profile and not an Extended Package).
    Although the requirements in this document apply
    to all application software that runs on any operating system, some assurance
    activities are necessarily specific to particular operating systems in order
    to provide precision and repeatability.  Additional test activities are
    sought from operating system vendors so that coverage across platforms
    is as complete as possible.

    <subsection title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">An application is defined
    as software that runs on an operating system and performs tasks on behalf
    of the user or owner of the system. As distinguished from applications,
    operating system software manages hardware resources and provides a runtime
    environment for applications. Applications that come bundled with an
    operating system (such as web browsers, email clients and media players)
    fall within the scope of these requirements. Naturally, third-party
	software such as <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> readers
	and downloadable smartphone apps is also in
    scope. Systems software that is delivered and installed with an application
    (such as kernel drivers) is considered part of the application for purposes
	of this document. <abbr title="Basic Input/Output System">BIOS</abbr> and
	other firmware, the operating system kernel, and
    other systems software (and drivers) that are included with the computing
    platform are outside the scope of this document.

        <note role="application">The ciphersuites to be tested in the evaluated configuration are
          limited by this requirement. The ST author should select the optional ciphersuites that are
          supported; if there are no ciphersuites supported other than the mandatory suites, then “None”
          should be selected. It is necessary to limit the ciphersuites that can be used in an evaluated
          configuration administratively on the server in the test environment. The Suite B algorithms
          listed above (RFC 6460) are the preferred algorithms for implementation.
          TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA is required in order to ensure compliance with RFC 5246.
          These requirements will be revisited as new TLS versions are standardized by the IETF.
          </note>
        <aactivity>The evaluator shall check the description of the implementation of this protocol
          in the <abbr linkend="TSS" /> to ensure that the ciphersuites supported are specified. The evaluator shall check
          the TSS to ensure that the ciphersuites specified include those listed for this component.
          The evaluator shall also check the operational guidance to ensure that it contains instructions
          on configuring the TOE so that TLS conforms to the description in the TSS.
          The evaluator shall also perform the following tests:
          <testlist>
          <test>The evaluator shall establish a TLS connection using each of
          the ciphersuites specified by the requirement. This connection may be
          established as part of the establishment of a higher-level protocol,
          e.g., as part of an EAP session. It is sufficient to observe the
          successful negotiation of a ciphersuite to satisfy the intent of the
          test; it is not necessary to examine the characteristics of the
          encrypted traffic in an attempt to discern the ciphersuite being used
          (for example, that the cryptographic algorithm is 128-bit AES and not
          256-bit AES).</test>
          <test>The evaluator shall attempt to establish the connection using a
            server with a server certificate that contains the Server Authentication purpose
            in the extendedKeyUsage field and verify that a connection is established.
            The evaluator will then verify that the client rejects an otherwise valid server
            certificate that lacks the Server Authentication purpose in the extendedKeyUsage
            field and a connection is not established. Ideally, the two certificates should be
            identical except for the extendedKeyUsage field.</test>
          <test>The evaluator shall send a server certificate in the TLS connection
            that the does not match the server-selected ciphersuite (for example, send a
            ECDSA certificate while using the TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA ciphersuite or
            send a RSA certificate while using one of the ECDSA ciphersuites.) The evaluator
            shall verify that the TOE disconnects after receiving the server’s Certificate
            handshake message.</test>
          <test>The evaluator shall configure the server to select the TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL
            ciphersuite and verify that the client denies the connection.</test>
          <test>The evaluator shall setup a man-in-the-middle tool between the
            TOE and the authentication server and shall perform the following
            modifications to the traffic: 
          <ul>
            <li>Change the TLS version selected by the server in the Server Hello to a non-supported TLS
              version (for example 1.3 represented by the two bytes 03 04) and verify that the
              client rejects the connection.</li>
            <li>Modify at least one byte in the server’s nonce in the Server Hello handshake
              message, and verify that the client rejects the Server Key Exchange handshake message
              (if using a DHE or ECDHE ciphersuite) or that the server denies the client’s Finished
              handshake message.</li>
            <li>Modify the server’s selected ciphersuite in the Server Hello handshake message
              to be a ciphersuite not presented in the Client Hello handshake message. The
              evaluator shall verify that the client rejects the connection after receiving
              the Server Hello.</li>
            <li>Modify the signature block in the Server’s Key Exchange handshake message,
              and verify that the client rejects the connection after receiving the Server Key
              Exchange message.</li>
            <li>Modify a byte in the Server Finished handshake message, and verify
              that the client sends a fatal alert upon receipt and does not send any
              application data.</li>
            <li>Send an unencrypted packet from the Server after the Server has

        <title>The TSF shall verify that the presented identifier matches the reference
          identifier according to RFC 6125</title>
        <note role="application">The rules for verification of identify are described in Section 6 of RFC 6125.
          The reference identifier is established by the user (e.g. entering a URL into a web browser
          or clicking a link), by configuration (e.g. configuring the name of a mail server or
          authentication server), or by an application (e.g. a parameter of an API)
          depending on the application service. Based on a singular reference identifier’s
          source domain and application service type (e.g. HTTP, SIP, LDAP), the client establishes
          all reference identifiers which are acceptable, such as a Common Name for the Subject Name
          field of the certificate and a (case-insensitive) DNS name, URI name, and Service Name for
          the Subject Alternative Name field. The client then compares this list of all acceptable
          reference identifiers to the presented identifiers in the TLS server’s certificate.
          The preferred method for verification is the Subject Alternative Name using DNS names,
          URI names, or Service Names. Verification using the Common Name is required for the purposes
          of backwards compatibility. Additionally, support for use of IP addresses in the Subject Name
          or Subject Alternative name is discouraged as against best practices but may be implemented.
          Finally, the client should avoid constructing reference identifiers using wildcards. However,
          if the presented identifiers include wildcards, the client must follow the best practices
          regarding matching; these best practices are captured in the assurance activity.</note>
        <aactivity>The evaluator shall ensure that the <abbr linkend="TSS" /> describes the client’s method
          of establishing all reference identifiers from the user/administrator/application-configured
          reference identifier, including which types of reference identifiers are supported (e.g Common
          Name, DNS Name, URI Name, Service Name, or other application-specific Subject Alternative Names)
          and whether IP addresses and wildcards are supported.  The evaluator shall ensure that this
          description identifies whether and the manner in which certificate pinning is supported or
          used by the TOE.
          
          The evaluator shall verify that the AGD guidance includes instructions for setting the
          reference identifier to be used for the purposes of certificate validation in TLS.
          
          The evaluator shall configure the reference identifier according to the AGD guidance
          and perform the following tests during a TLS connection:
        <testlist>
          <test>The evaluator shall present a server certificate that does not contain an identifier
            in either the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) or Common Name (CN) that matches the reference
            identifier. The evaluator shall verify that the connection fails.
          </test>
          <test>The evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a CN that matches the reference
            identifier, contains the SAN extension, but does not contain an identifier in the SAN that matches
            the reference identifier.  The evaluator shall verify that the connection fails. The evaluator shall
            repeat this test for each supported SAN type.</test>
          <test>The evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a CN that matches the reference
            identifier and does not contains the SAN extension. The evaluator shall verify that the connection
            succeeds.</test>
          <test>The evaluator shall present a server certificate that contains a CN that does not match the
            reference identifier but does contain an identifier in the SAN that matches.  The evaluator shall
            verify that the connection succeeds.</test>
          <test>The evaluator shall perform the following wildcard tests with each supported type of reference
            identifier:
          <ul>
            <li>The evaluator shall present a server certificate containing a wildcard that is not in the left-most
              label of the presented identifier (e.g. foo.*.example.com) and verify that the connection fails.</li>
            <li>The evaluator shall present a server certificate containing a wildcard in the left-most label
              (e.g. *.example.com). The evaluator shall configure the reference identifier with a single left-most label
              (e.g. foo.example.com) and verify that the connection succeeds. The evaluator shall configure the reference
              identifier without a left-most label as in the certificate (e.g. example.com) and verify that the connection fails.
              The evaluator shall configure the reference identifier with two left-most labels (e.g. bar.foo.example.come) and
              verify that the connection fails.</li>
          </ul></test>
          <test>[conditional] If URI or Service name reference identifiers are supported, the evaluator shall configure the
            DNS name and the service identifier.  The evaluator shall present a server certificate containing the correct DNS
            name and service identifier in the URIName or SRVName fields of the SAN and verify that the connection succeeds.
            The evaluator shall repeat this test with the wrong service identifier (but correct DNS name) and verify that the
            connection fails</test>
          <test>[conditional] If pinned certificates are supported the evaluator shall present a certificate that does not
            match the pinned certificate and verify that the connection fails.</test>

  <section title="Security Assurance Requirements" id="SARs">The Security
  Objectives for the <abbr linkend="TOE" /> in 
  <secref linkend="req" /> were constructed to address threats identified in 
  <secref linkend="threats" />. <abbr linkend="SFR" />s in 
  <secref linkend="SFRs" /> are a formal instantiation of the Security
  Objectives. The PP draws from <abbr title="Evaluation Assurance Level">EAL</abbr>1 the <abbr linkend="SAR" />s)
  to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation
  applicable for the evaluation and performs independent testing. 
  <br />While this section contains the complete set of SARs from the CC, the
  Assurance Activities to be performed by an evaluator are detailed in 
  <secref linkend="SFRs" /> as well as in this section. The general model for
  evaluation of TOEs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows: 
  <br />After the ST has been approved for evaluation, the <abbr class="expanded" title="Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility">ITSEF</abbr> will obtain
  the TOE, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative guides for the
  TOE. The Assurance Activities listed in the ST (which will be refined by the
  ITSEF to be TOE-specific, either within the ST or in a separate document)
  will then be performed by the ITSEF. The ITSEF is also expected to perform
  all of the actions mandated by the <cite linkend="bibCEM" /> for
  EAL1. The results of these activities will be documented and presented (along
  with the administrative guidance used) for validation. 
  <br />For each family, "Developer Notes" are provided on the developer action
  elements to clarify what, if any, additional documentation/activity needs to
  be provided by the developer. For the content/presentation and evaluator
  activity elements, additional assurance activities (to those already
  contained in 
  <secref linkend="SFRs" /> and the CEM for EAL1) are described as a whole for
  the family rather than for each element. Additionally, the assurance
  activities described in this section are complementary to those specified in 
  <secref linkend="SFRs" />. 
  <br />The TOE security assurance requirements, summarized in the table below,
  identify the management and evaluative activities required to meet the
  objectives identified in 
  <secref linkend="obj" /> of this PP. 
  <!-- Generate a table here, based on the next sections -->

  directly invokable by TOE users, there is little point specifying that such
  interfaces be described in and of themselves since only indirect testing of
  such interfaces may be possible. For this PP, the activities for this family
  should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in the <abbr linkend="TSS" /> in response
  to the functional requirements and the interfaces presented in the AGD

      the evaluator shall check the AGD guidance and <abbr linkend="TOE" /> samples received for
      testing to ensure that the version number is consistent with that in the
      ST. If the vendor maintains a web site advertising the TOE, the evaluator
      shall examine the information on the web site to ensure that the

      <aactivity>The "evaluation evidence required by the SARs" in this PP is
      limited to the information in the ST coupled with the guidance provided
      to administrators and users under the AGD requirements. By ensuring that
      the <abbr linkend="TOE" /> is specifically identified and that this identification is
      consistent in the ST and in the AGD guidance (as done in the assurance
      activity for ALC_CMC.1), the evaluator implicitly confirms the
      information required by this component. Life-cycle support is targeted
      aspects of the developer’s life-cycle and instructions to providers of
      applications for the developer’s devices, rather than an in-depth
      examination of the <abbr linkend="TSF" /> manufacturer’s development and configuration
      management process. This is not meant to diminish the critical role that
      a developer’s practices play in contributing to the overall
      trustworthiness of a product; rather, it’s a reflection on the
      information to be made available for evaluation. 
      <br />
      The evaluator shall ensure that the developer has identified (in
      guidance documentation for application developers concerning the targeted platform) one or more
      development environments appropriate for use in developing applications
      for the developer’s platform. For each of these development environments,
      the developer shall provide information on how to configure the
      environment to ensure that buffer overflow protection mechanisms in the
      environment(s) are invoked (e.g., compiler flags). The evaluator shall
      ensure that this documentation also includes an indication of whether
      such protections are on by default, or have to be specifically enabled.
      The evaluator shall ensure that the TSF is uniquely identified (with
      respect to other products from the TSF vendor), and that documentation
      provided by the developer in association with the requirements in the ST
      is associated with the TSF using this unique identification.</aactivity>

  <subsection id="ate" title="Class ATE: Tests">Testing is specified for
  functional aspects of the system as well as aspects that take advantage of
  design or implementation weaknesses. The former is done through the ATE_IND
  family, while the latter is through the AVA_VAN family. At the assurance
  level specified in this PP, testing is based on advertised functionality and
  interfaces with dependency on the availability of design information. One of
  the primary outputs of the evaluation process is the test report as specified
  in the following requirements. 
  <a-component id="ate_ind.1" name="Independent Testing – Conformance (ATE_IND.1)">
  Testing is performed to confirm the functionality described in the <abbr linkend="TSS" /> as
  well as the administrative (including configuration and operational)
  documentation provided. The focus of the testing is to confirm that the
  requirements specified in 
  <secref linkend="SFRs" /> being met, although some additional testing is
  specified for SARs in 
  <secref linkend="SARs" />. The Assurance Activities identify the additional
  testing activities associated with these components. The evaluator produces a
  test report documenting the plan for and results of testing, as well as
  coverage arguments focused on the platform/<abbr linkend="TOE" /> combinations that are claiming
  conformance to this PP. Given the scope of the TOE and its associated
  evaluation evidence requirements, this component’s assurance activities are
  covered by the assurance activities listed for ALC_CMC.1.

    <aactivity>The evaluator shall prepare a test plan and report documenting
    the testing aspects of the system. The test plan covers all of the testing
    actions contained in the <cite linkend="bibCEM" /> and the body of this PP’s Assurance
    Activities. While it is not necessary to have one test case per test listed
    in an Assurance Activity, the evaluator must document in the test plan that
    each applicable testing requirement in the ST is covered. The test plan
    identifies the platforms to be tested, and for those platforms not included
    in the test plan but included in the ST, the test plan provides a
    justification for not testing the platforms. This justification must
    address the differences between the tested platforms and the untested
    platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not affect the
    testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
    differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms
    claimed in the ST are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
    describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that
    is necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should
    be noted that the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for
    installation and setup of each platform either as part of a test or as a
    standard pre-test condition. This may include special test drivers or
    tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not just an assertion) should
    be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely affect the
    performance of the functionality by the <abbr linkend="TOE" /> and its platform. This also
    includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be used. The
    cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
    this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec,
    TLS/HTTPS, SSH). The test plan identifies high-level test objectives as
    well as the test procedures to be followed to achieve those objectives.
    These procedures include expected results. The test report (which could
    just be an annotated version of the test plan) details the activities that
    took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes the actual
    results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
    test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful
    re-run of the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and
    the supporting details), and not just the “pass” result.</aactivity>

  <subsection id="ava" title="Class AVA: Vulnerability Assessment">For the
  first generation of this protection profile, the evaluation lab is expected
  to survey open sources to discover what vulnerabilities have been discovered
  in these types of products. In most cases, these vulnerabilities will require
  sophistication beyond that of a basic attacker. Until penetration tools are
  created and uniformly distributed to the evaluation labs, the evaluator will
  not be expected to test for these vulnerabilities in the <abbr linkend="TOE" />. The labs will
  be expected to comment on the likelihood of these vulnerabilities given the
  documentation provided by the vendor. This information will be used in the
  development of penetration testing tools and for the development of future
  protection profiles.

      <aactivity>As with ATE_IND, the evaluator shall generate a report to
      document their findings with respect to this requirement. This report
      could physically be part of the overall test report mentioned in ATE_IND,
      or a separate document. The evaluator performs a search of public
      information to determine the vulnerabilities that have been found in
      network infrastructure devices and the implemented communication
      protocols in general, as well as those that pertain to the particular
      TOE. The evaluator documents the sources consulted and the
      vulnerabilities found in the report. For each vulnerability found, the
      evaluator either provides a rationale with respect to its
      non-applicability, or the evaluator formulates a test (using the
      guidelines provided in ATE_IND) to confirm the vulnerability, if
      suitable. Suitability is determined by assessing the attack vector needed
      to take advantage of the vulnerability. If exploiting the vulnerability
      requires expert skills and an electron microscope, for instance, then a
      test would not be suitable and an appropriate justification would be
      formulated.</aactivity>
