    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to
      describe the security functionality of application software in terms of <cite linkend="bibCC"
      /> and to define functional and assurance requirements for such software. In recent years,
      software attacks have shifted from targeting operating systems to targeting applications. This
      has been the natural response to improvements in operating system security and development
      processes. As a result, it is paramount that the security of applications be improved to
      reduce the risk of compromise.</section>

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription"><h:p>The requirements in this
  	  document apply to application software which runs on any type of platform.
Some application types are covered by more specific PPs, which may be expressed as Modules of this PP.
  	  Such applications are subject to the requirements of both this PP and the
  	  Module(s) that addresses their special functionality.  PPs for some 
	  particularly specialized applications may not be expressed as Module at this time,
	  though the requirements in this document should be seen as objectives for those 
	  highly specialized applications.
	  </h:p><h:p> 
	  Although the requirements in this document apply to a wide range of application
	  software, consult guidance from the relevant national schemes to
	  determine when formal Common Criteria evaluation is expected for a
	  particular type of application.  This may vary depending upon the nature
	  of the security functionality of the application.
	</h:p>
	  <subsection title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
	    <h:p>
		The application, which consists of the software provided by its vendor,
		is installed onto the platform(s) it operates on.  It executes on the platform, which
		may be an operating system (<figref refid="toe-as-apponos"/>), hardware enviroment, 
		    a software based execution environment, 
		    or some combination of these (<figref refid="toe-as-apponee"/>). Those platforms may themselves run within other
		    environments, such as virtual machines or operating systems, that completely abstract away the underlying hardware
		    from the application. The TOE is not accountable for security functionality that is implemented by 
		    platform layers that are abstracted away.
		Some assurance activities are specific to the particular platform
		on which the application runs, in order to provide precision and
		repeatability. The only platforms currently recognized by the SWApp PP are those specified in SFR Evaluation Activities.
		    To test on a platform for which there are no EAs, a Vendor should contact NIAP with recommended EAs.
		    NIAP will determine if the proposed platform is appropriate for the PP and accept, reject,
		    or develop EAs as necessary in coordination with the technical community.
		</h:p><h:p>	
		Applications include a diverse range of software such as office suites, thin
		clients, <h:abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</h:abbr> readers, downloadable
		smartphone apps, and apps running in a cloud container. The TOE includes 
		any software in the application installation package, even those pieces that may 
		extend or modify the functionality of the underlying platform, such as kernel drivers.  
		Many platforms come bundled with applications
		such as web browsers, email clients and media players and these too
		should be considered subject to the requirements defined in this
		document although the expectation of formal Common Criteria evaluation
		depends upon the national scheme.  <h:abbr title="Basic Input/Output
		System">BIOS</h:abbr> and other firmware, the operating system kernel,
		and other systems software (and drivers) provided as part of the
		platform are outside the scope of this document.

              platform interface (API) is used to obtain the random numbers.  The evaluator shall confirm 
              that each of these interfaces corresponds to the acceptable interfaces listed for each platform 
              below.  The evaluator shall then decompile the application binary using an decompiler

              appears in the output.  If the representation of the API does not correspond directly to

                  second block of random bits (4) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the 
                  second block of random bits is the expected value. The evaluator shall generate 
                  eight input values for each trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The next three 
                  are entropy input, nonce, and personalization string for the instantiate 
                  operation. The next two are additional input and entropy input for the first call 
                  to generate. The final two are additional input and entropy input for the second
                  call to generate. These values are randomly generated. “generate one block of 
                  random bits” means to generate random bits with number of returned bits equal to 
                  the Output Block Length (as defined in NIST SP 800-90A).
                  <h:br />
                  If the RNG does not have prediction resistance, each trial consists of (1) 
                  instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) reseed, (4) 
                  generate a second block of random bits (5) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies 
                  that the second block of random bits is the expected value. The evaluator shall 
                  generate eight input values for each trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The 
                  next three are entropy input, nonce, and personalization string for the 
                  instantiate operation. The fifth value is additional input to the first call to
                  generate. The sixth and seventh are additional input and entropy input to the call 
                  to reseed. The final value is additional input to the second generate call.

                  The following paragraphs contain more information on some of the input values to 
                  be generated/selected by the evaluator.
                  <h:br />
                  <h:b>Entropy input:</h:b> the length of the entropy input value must equal the seed length.
                  <h:br />
                  <h:b>Nonce:</h:b> If a nonce is supported (CTR_DRBG with no Derivation Function does not use 
                  a nonce), the nonce bit length is one-half the seed length. 
                  <h:br />
                  <h:b>Personalization string:</h:b> The length of the personalization string must be 
                  less then or equal to seed length. If the implementation only supports one 
                  personalization string length, then the same length can be used for both values. 
                  If more than one string length is support, the evaluator shall use personalization 
                  strings of two different lengths. If the implementation does not use a 
                  personalization string, no value needs to be supplied. 
                  <h:br />
                  <h:b>Additional input:</h:b> the additional input bit lengths have the same defaults 
                  and restrictions as the personalization string lengths.

              The ST author shall select all key establishment schemes used for the selected cryptographic 
              protocols. FCS_TLSC_EXT.1 requires cipher suites that use RSA-based key establishment 
              schemes.
              <h:br />
              The RSA-based key establishment schemes are described in Section 9 of NIST SP 800-56B; 
              however, Section 9 relies on implementation of other sections in SP 800-56B. If the TOE acts 
              as a receiver in the RSA key establishment scheme, the TOE does not need to implement 
              RSA key generation.
              <h:br />
              The elliptic curves used for the key establishment scheme shall correlate with the curves 
              specified in <linkref linkend="FCS_CKM.1.1(1)"/>.
              <h:br />
              The domain parameters used for the finite field-based key establishment scheme are specified 
              by the key generation according to <linkref linkend="FCS_CKM.1.1(1)"/>.
            </note>
            <aactivity>
              The evaluator shall ensure that the supported key establishment schemes correspond to the 
              key generation schemes identified in FCS_CKM.1.1. If the ST specifies more than one 
              scheme, the evaluator shall examine the TSS to verify that it identifies the usage for each 
              scheme.
              <h:br /> 
              The evaluator shall verify that the AGD guidance instructs the administrator how to configure 
              the TOE to use the selected key establishment scheme(s).
              <h:br />
              Assurance Activity Note: The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test 
              platform that provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found on factory 
              products.
              <h:br />
              <h:b>Key Establishment Schemes</h:b><h:p/>
              The evaluator shall verify the implementation of the key establishment schemes supported by 
              the TOE using the applicable tests below. 
              <h:br />
              <h:b>SP800-56A Key Establishment Schemes</h:b><h:p/>
              The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of SP800-56A key agreement schemes 
              using the following Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key agreement 
              scheme verify that a TOE has implemented the components of the key agreement scheme 
              according to the specifications in the Recommendation. These components include the 
              calculation of the DLC primitives (the shared secret value Z) and the calculation of the 
              derived keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation 
              is supported, the evaluator shall also verify that the components of key confirmation have 
              been implemented correctly, using the test procedures described below. This includes the 
              parsing of the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of MACtag.
              <h:br />
              <indent>
                <h:b>Function Test</h:b><h:p/>
                The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement 
                schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors 
                from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each supported 
                key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type, and, if supported, 
                key confirmation role- key confirmation type combination, the tester shall generate 10 
                sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain parameter values (FFC) or 
                the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, 
                ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being tested.
                <h:br />
                The evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static and/or 
                ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other 
                Information <h:i>(OtherInfo)</h:i> and TOE id fields.
                <h:br />
                If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator shall obtain only 
                the public keys and the hashed value of the shared secret.
                <h:br />
                The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given 
                scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value, 
                derive the keying material DKM, and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from 
                these values.
                <h:br />
                If key confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each implemented 
                approved MAC algorithm.
                <h:br />
                <h:b>Validity Test</h:b><h:p/>
                The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid and 
                invalid key agreement results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this test, the 
                evaluator shall obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions included in the 
                SP800-56A key agreement implementation to determine which errors the TOE should 
                be able to recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors 
                consisting of data sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves, the 
                evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s public/private key pairs, MACTag, and any inputs 
                used in the KDF, such as the OtherInfo and TOE id fields.
                <h:br />
                The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE 
                recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: 
                the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the OtherInfo field, the data to be 
                MACed, or the generated MACTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial (only ECC) 
                public key validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors in both parties’ 
                static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the TOE’s static private key 
                to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key validation function and/or the partial 
                key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test vectors shall remain 
                unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results (they should 
                pass).
                <h:br />
                The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme 
                using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results with 
                the results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects these 
                errors.
                <h:br />

              <h:b>SP800-56B Key Establishment Schemes</h:b><h:p/>
              The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes whether the TOE acts as a sender, a 
              recipient, or both for RSA-based key establishment schemes.
              <h:br />
              If the TOE acts as a sender, the following assurance activity shall be performed to ensure the 
              proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based key establishment 
              scheme:
              <h:br />
              <indent>
                To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known 
                good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of 
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without key confirmation 
                if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key confirmation 
                is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is 
                supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector shall 
                include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any additional input 
                parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key confirmation is 
                incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the evaluator shall 
                perform a key establishment encryption operation on the TOE with the same inputs 
                (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use the MacKey from 
                the test vector instead of the randomly generated MacKey used in normal operation) 
                and ensure that the outputted ciphertext is equivalent to the ciphertext in the test 
                vector.
              </indent>
              <h:br />
              If the TOE acts as a receiver, the following assurance activities shall be performed to ensure 
              the proper operation of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based key establishment 
              scheme:
              <h:br />
              <indent>
                To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known 
                good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of 
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with our without key 
                confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key 
                confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is 
                supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector 
                shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext keying material (KeyData), any 
                additional input parameters if applicable, the MacTag in cases where key 
                confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the 
                evaluator shall perform the key establishment decryption operation on the TOE and 
                ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material (KeyData) is equivalent to the 
                plaintext keying material in the test vector. In cases where key confirmation is 
                incorporated, the evaluator shall perform the key confirmation steps and ensure that 
                the outputted MacTag is equivalent to the MacTag in the test vector.
              </indent>
              <h:br />
              The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the TOE handles decryption errors. In 
              accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-56B, the TOE must not reveal the particular 
              error that occurred, either through the contents of any outputted or logged error message or 
              through timing variations. If KTS-OAEP is supported, the evaluator shall create separate 
              contrived ciphertext values that trigger each of the three decryption error checks described in 
              NIST Special Publication 800-56B section 7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt 
              results in an error, and ensure that any outputted or logged error message is identical for each. 
              If KTS-KEM-KWS is supported, the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext 
              values that trigger each of the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special

			The evaluator checks the AGD documents to determine that any configuration that 
			is required to be done to configure the functionality for the required modes
			and key sizes is present. The evaluator shall perform all of the 
			following tests for each algorithm implemented by the TSF and used to
			satisfy the requirements of this PP:
			<h:br/>
              <h:b>AES-CBC Known Answer Tests</h:b>
              <h:p />There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs), described below. In
              all KATs, the plaintext, ciphertext, and IV values shall be 128-bit
              blocks. The results from each test may either be obtained by the
              evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer
              and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness,
              the evaluator shall compare the resulting values to those obtained
              by submitting the same inputs to a known good implementation. 
              <h:ul>
                <h:li>KAT-1. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the
                evaluator shall supply a set of 10 plaintext values and obtain
                the ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC encryption of the
                given plaintext using a key value of all zeros and an IV of all
                zeros. Five plaintext values shall be encrypted with a 128-bit
                all-zeros key, and the other five shall be encrypted with a
                256-bit all- zeros key. To test the decrypt functionality of
                AES-CBC, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for
                encrypt, using 10 ciphertext values as input and AES-CBC
                decryption.</h:li>
                <h:li>KAT-2. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the
                evaluator shall supply a set of 10 key values and obtain the
                ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC encryption of an
                all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of all
                zeros. Five of the keys shall be 128-bit keys, and the other five
                shall be 256-bit keys. To test the decrypt functionality of
                AES-CBC, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for
                encrypt, using an all-zero ciphertext value as input and AES-CBC
                decryption.</h:li>
                <h:li>KAT-3. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the
                evaluator shall supply the two sets of key values described below
                and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES encryption
                of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of
                all zeros. The first set of keys shall have 128 128-bit keys, and
                the second set shall have 256 256-bit keys. Key i in each set
                shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits
                be zeros, for i in [1,N]. To test the decrypt functionality of
                AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply the two sets of key and
                ciphertext value pairs described below and obtain the plaintext
                value that results from AES-CBC decryption of the given
                ciphertext using the given key and an IV of all zeros. The first
                set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 128 128-bit key/ciphertext
                pairs, and the second set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 256
                256-bit key/ciphertext pairs. Key i in each set shall have the
                leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for
                i in [1,N]. The ciphertext value in each pair shall be the value
                that results in an all-zeros plaintext when decrypted with its
                corresponding key.</h:li>
                <h:li>KAT-4. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the
                evaluator shall supply the set of 128 plaintext values described
                below and obtain the two ciphertext values that result from
                AES-CBC encryption of the given plaintext using a 128-bit key
                value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros and using a 256-bit
                key value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros, respectively.
                Plaintext value i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be
                ones and the rightmost 128-i bits be zeros, for i in
                [1,128].</h:li>
              </h:ul>To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator
              shall perform the same test as for encrypt, using ciphertext values
              of the same form as the plaintext in the encrypt test as input and
              AES-CBC decryption. 
              <h:br />
              <h:b>AES-CBC Multi-Block Message Test</h:b>
              <h:p />The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality by
              encrypting an i-block message where 1 &lt; i &lt;= 10. The
              evaluator shall choose a key, an IV and plaintext message of length
              i blocks and encrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with
              the chosen key and IV. The ciphertext shall be compared to the
              result of encrypting the same plaintext message with the same key
              and IV using a known good implementation. The evaluator shall also
              test the decrypt functionality for each mode by decrypting an
              i-block message where 1 &lt; i &lt;=10. The evaluator shall choose
              a key, an IV and a ciphertext message of length i blocks and
              decrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with the chosen
              key and IV. The plaintext shall be compared to the result of
              decrypting the same ciphertext message with the same key and IV
              using a known good implementation. AES-CBC Monte Carlo Tests The
              evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using a set of 200
              plaintext, IV, and key 3- tuples. 100 of these shall use 128 bit
              keys, and 100 shall use 256 bit keys. The plaintext and IV values
              shall be 128-bit blocks. For each 3-tuple, 1000 iterations shall be
              run as follows: 
              <h:pre>
              # Input: PT, IV, Key
              for i = 1 to 1000:
                if i == 1:
                      CT[1] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, IV, PT)
                      PT = IV
                else:
                  CT[i] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, PT) 
                  PT = CT[i-1]
              </h:pre>The ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration (i.e.,
              CT[1000]) is the result for that trial. This result shall be
              compared to the result of running 1000 iterations with the same
              values using a known good implementation.
              <h:br />The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality using the
              same test as for encrypt, exchanging CT and PT and replacing
              AES-CBC-Encrypt with AES-CBC-Decrypt. 
              <h:br />
              <h:b>AES-GCM Monte Carlo Tests</h:b>
              <h:p />The evaluator shall test the authenticated encrypt
              functionality of AES-GCM for each combination of the following
              input parameter lengths: 
              <h:ul>
                <h:li>128 bit and 256 bit keys</h:li>
                <h:li>Two plaintext lengths. One of the plaintext lengths shall be
                a non-zero integer multiple of 128 bits, if
                supported. The other plaintext length shall not be an integer
                multiple of 128 bits, if supported.</h:li>
                <h:li>Three AAD lengths. One AAD length shall be 0, if supported.
                One AAD length shall be a non-zero integer
                multiple of 128 bits, if supported. One AAD length shall not be
                an integer multiple of 128 bits, if
                supported.</h:li>
                <h:li>Two IV lengths. If 96 bit IV is supported, 96 bits shall be
                one of the two IV lengths tested.</h:li>
              </h:ul>The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using a set
              of 10 key, plaintext, AAD, and IV tuples for each combination of
              parameter lengths above and obtain the ciphertext value and tag
              that results from AES-GCM authenticated encrypt. Each supported tag
              length shall be tested at least once per set of 10. The IV value
              may be supplied by the evaluator or the implementation being
              tested, as long as it is known. 
              <h:br />The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality using a
              set of 10 key, ciphertext, tag, AAD, and IV 5-tuples for each
              combination of parameter lengths above and obtain a Pass/Fail
              result on authentication and the decrypted plaintext if Pass. The
              set shall include five tuples that Pass and five that Fail. 
              <h:br />The results from each test may either be obtained by the
              evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer
              and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness,
              the evaluator shall compare the resulting values to those obtained
              by submitting the same inputs to a known good
              implementation.
		    
	      <h:br />
              <h:b>AES-XTS Tests</h:b>
        <h:p />The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality of XTS-AES for each combination
	of the following input parameter lengths:
	<h:br />
	256 bit (for AES-128) and 512 bit (for AES-256) keys
	<h:br /><h:br />Three data unit (i.e., plaintext) lengths. One of the data unit lengths shall be a
	non-zero integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. One of the data unit lengths
	shall be an integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. The third data unit length
	shall be either the longest supported data unit length or 216 bits, whichever is
	smaller.
	<h:br /><h:br />Using a set of 100 (key, plaintext and 128-bit random tweak value) 3-tuples and
	obtain the ciphertext that results from XTS-AES encrypt.
	<h:br />The evaluator may supply a data unit sequence number instead of the tweak value if
	the implementation supports it. The data unit sequence number is a base-10 number
	ranging between 0 and 255 that implementations convert to a tweak value internally.
	<h:br /><h:br />The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality of XTS-AES using the same test as
	for encrypt, replacing plaintext values with ciphertext values and XTS-AES encrypt
	with XTS-AES decrypt.

            hashes only messages that are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e., the length

            bit-oriented mode. In this mode the <abbr title="TOE Security Functionality" linkend="TSF">TSF</abbr> hashes messages of arbitrary 
            length. As there are different tests for each mode, an indication is given in the 
            following sections for the bit-oriented vs. the byte-oriented testmacs. The evaluator

              a distinction; otherwise, the least common set of ciphersuites can be specified in the single SFR. Also note that the testing

            <note role="application">
              The rules for verification of identity are described in Section 6 of RFC 6125. The 
              reference identifier is established by the user (e.g. entering a URL into a web 
              browser or clicking a link), by configuration (e.g. configuring the name of a mail 
              server or authentication server), or by an application (e.g. a parameter of an API) 
              depending on the application service. Based on a singular reference identifier’s 
              source domain and application service type (e.g. HTTP, SIP, LDAP), the client 
              establishes all reference identifiers which are acceptable, such as a Common Name for 
              the Subject Name field of the certificate and a (case-insensitive) DNS name, URI name, 
              and Service Name for the Subject Alternative Name field. The client then compares this 
              list of all acceptable reference identifiers to the presented identifiers in the 
              <h:abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</h:abbr> server’s certificate.
             <h:br />
              The preferred method for verification is the Subject Alternative Name using DNS names, 
              URI names, or Service Names. Verification using the Common Name is required for the 
              purposes of backwards compatibility. Additionally, support for use of IP addresses in 
              the Subject Name or Subject Alternative name is discouraged as against best practices 
              but may be implemented.  Finally, the client should avoid constructing reference 
              identifiers using wildcards. However, if the presented identifiers include wildcards, 
              the client must follow the best practices regarding matching; these best practices are 
              captured in the assurance activity.

              are limited by this requirement. It is necessary to limit the cipher suites that can be used in an evaluated
              configuration administratively on the server in the test environment. The Suite B 
              algorithms listed above (RFC 6460) are the preferred algorithms for implementation. 
              TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA is mandatory in RFC 5246 but has been moved to the selection based ciphersuites 
              for this Protection Profile. 
              <h:br />
              These requirements will be revisited as new 
              <h:abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</h:abbr> versions are standardized by the 
              IETF.
              <h:br />
              If any cipher suites are selected using ECDHE, then 
              <linkref linkend="FCS_TLSC_EXT.4"/> is required.
              <h:br />
              If <h:i>implement TLS 1.2 (RFC 5246)</h:i> is selected, then

              When "invoke platform-provided TLS 1.2" is selected, it may be the case that the application is being claimed to run on more
              than one platform, and the underlying platforms support different sets of ciphersuites that are subsets of the ciphersuites 
              listed in the select for the SFR. In this case, it is expected that the
	      <abbr title="Security Target" linkend="ST">ST</abbr>
	      author iterate this requirement for each platform or set of platforms; each iteration would have the set of 
              ciphersuites implemented by the platform(s). Note this is only necessary if the application wants to make
              a distinction; otherwise, the least common set of ciphersuites can be specified in the single SFR. Also note that the testing 
              requirements would be applied to each iteration (meaning application/platform combination) during the evaluation.

			  On some platforms, the application must explicitly solicit permission

			  Seeking such permissions, even if the application does not later make use of the
			  hardware resource, should still be considered access.
			  Selections should be expressed in a manner consistent with how the application expresses
			  its access needs to the underlying platform.  For example,
			  the platform may provide <h:i>location services</h:i> which implies the potential use of a variety
			  of hardware resources (e.g. satellite receivers, WiFi, cellular radio)
			  yet <h:i>location services</h:i> is the proper selection.  This is because use of these resources
			  can be inferred, but also because the actual usage may vary based on the particular platform.
              Resources that do not need to be explicitly identified are
              those which are ordinarily used by any application such as central processing units,

              The evaluator shall ensure the <abbr title="TOE Summary Specification" linkend="TSS">TSS</abbr> describes where the check of 
              validity of the certificates takes place. The evaluator ensures the 
              <abbr title="TOE Summary Specification" linkend="TSS">TSS</abbr> also provides a description of the certificate path validation 
              algorithm.
              <h:br /> 
              The tests described must be performed in conjunction with the other certificate 
              services assurance activities, including the functions in <linkref linkend="FIA_X509_EXT.2.1"/>. The tests 
              for the extendedKeyUsage rules are performed in conjunction with the uses that require 
              those rules. If the application supports chains of length four or greater, 
	      the evaluator shall create a chain of at least four certificates: the 
              node certificate to be tested, two Intermediate CAs, and the self-signed Root CA.
	      If the application supports a maximum trust depth of two, then a chain with
	      no Intermediate CA should instead be created.
              <testlist>
                <test>
                  The evaluator shall demonstrate that validating a certificate without a valid 
                  certification path results in the function failing. The evaluator shall then load 
                  a certificate or certificates as trusted CAs needed to validate the certificate to 
                  be used in the function, and demonstrate that the function succeeds. The evaluator 
                  shall then delete one of the certificates, and show that the function fails.
                </test>
                <test>
                  The evaluator shall demonstrate that validating an expired certificate results in

                  The evaluator shall test that the <abbr title="Target of Evaluation" linkend="TOE">TOE</abbr> can properly handle 
                  revoked certificates-–conditional on whether CRL, OCSP, or OCSP Stapling is selected;
                  if multiple methods are selected, then the following tests shall be performed 
		  for each method:
		  <h:ul>
		    <h:li>
		      The evaluator shall test revocation of the node certificate. 
		    </h:li>
		    <h:li>
		      The evaluator shall also test revocation of an intermediate CA certificate 
		      (i.e. the intermediate CA certificate should be revoked by the root CA), 
		      if intermediate CA certificates are supported. 
		    </h:li>
		  </h:ul>
		  The evaluator shall ensure that a valid certificate is used, and that the 
                  validation function succeeds. The evaluator then attempts the test with a 
                  certificate that has been revoked (for each method chosen in the selection) to 
                  ensure when the certificate is no longer valid that the validation function fails.
                </test>
                <test>
                  If OCSP is selected, the evaluator shall configure the OCSP server or use a 
                  man-in-the-middle tool to present a certificate that does not have the OCSP 
                  signing purpose and verify that validation of the OCSP response fails. If CRL is 
                  selected, the evaluator shall configure the CA to sign a CRL with a certificate 
                  that does not have the cRLsign key usage bit set, and verify that validation of 
                  the CRL fails.
                </test>
                <test>
                  The evaluator shall modify any byte in the first eight bytes of the certificate 
                  and demonstrate that the certificate fails to validate. (The certificate will fail 
                  to parse correctly.)

      <secref linkend="threats"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (<abbr title="Security Functional Requirement" linkend="SFR">SFR</abbr>s)
      in <secref linkend="SFRs"/> are a formal
      instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP identifies the Security Assurance Requirements
      (<abbr title="Security Assurance Requirement" linkend="SAR">SAR</abbr>s) to frame the
      extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and
      performs independent testing.
      <h:br/>
      This section lists the set of <abbr title="Security Assurance Requirement" linkend="SAR">SAR</abbr>s from CC part 3 that are required in
      evaluations against this
      PP. Individual Evaluation Activities (EAs) to be performed are specified both
      in <secref linkend="req"/> as well as in this section.
      <h:br/>
      The general model for evaluation of <abbr title="Target of Evaluation" linkend="TOE">TOE</abbr>s against STs written to conform to
      this PP is as follows:
      <h:br/>
      After the <abbr title="Security Target" linkend="ST">ST</abbr> has been approved for evaluation, the <abbr class="expanded"
      title="Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility">ITSEF</abbr> will obtain the
      <abbr title="Target of Evaluation" linkend="TOE">TOE</abbr>, supporting
      environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for the TOE. The ITSEF is expected to
      perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and
      ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Assurance Activities contained within <secref linkend="req"/>,
      which are intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM assurance requirements as they
      apply to the specific technology instantiated in the TOE. The Assurance Activities that are
      captured in <secref linkend="req"/> also provide clarification as to what the developer needs
      to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant with the PP.

          linkend="bibCEM"/>.</subsection>
      <subsection title="Class ADV: Development" id="adv">The information about the <abbr

          specification describes the <h:abbr title="TSF Interface">TSFI</h:abbr>s. It is not necessary
          to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally, because
            <abbr title="Target of Evaluation" linkend="TOE">TOE</abbr>s conforming to this PP will necessarily have interfaces to the
          Operational Environment that are not directly invokable by <abbr title="Target of Evaluation" linkend="TOE">TOE</abbr> users, 
          there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of themselves 
          since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP, the 
          activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in the 
          <abbr title="TOE Summary Specification" linkend="TSS">TSS</abbr> in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces 
          presented in the AGD documentation. No additional “functional specification” documentation 
          is necessary to satisfy the assurance activities specified. The interfaces that need to be

              under the AGD requirements. By ensuring that the <abbr title="Target of Evaluation" linkend="TOE">TOE</abbr> is specifically
              identified and that this identification is consistent in the <abbr title="Security Target" linkend="ST">ST</abbr> and in the AGD

              aspects of the developer’s life-cycle and instructions to providers of applications
              for the developer’s devices, rather than an in-depth examination of the <abbr

              This is not meant to diminish the critical role that a developer’s practices play in

              of these development environments, the developer shall provide information on how to
              configure the environment to ensure that buffer overflow protection mechanisms in the

              While it
              is not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the <abbr title="Security Target" linkend="ST">ST</abbr> is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be tested, and for those
              platforms not included in the test plan but included in the <abbr title="Security Target" linkend="ST">ST</abbr>, the test plan provides
              a justification for not testing the platforms. This justification must address the
              differences between the tested platforms and the untested platforms, and make an
              argument that the differences do not affect the testing to be performed. It is not
              sufficient to merely assert that the differences have no effect; rationale must be
              provided. If all platforms claimed in the <abbr title="Security Target" linkend="ST">ST</abbr> are tested, then no rationale is
              necessary. The test plan describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and
              any setup that is necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It
              should be noted that the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for
              installation and setup of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard
              pre-test condition. This may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or
              tool, an argument (not just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool
              will not adversely affect the performance of the functionality by the <abbr

              <h:br/>
              This also includes the configuration of the
              cryptographic engine to be used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this
              engine are those specified by this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being
              evaluated (IPsec, TLS, SSH). The test plan identifies high-level test objectives
              as well as the test procedures to be followed to achieve those objectives. These
              procedures include expected results. 
              <h:br/>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated
              version of the test plan) details the activities that took place when the test
              procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the tests. This shall be
              a cumulative account, so if there was a test run that resulted in a failure; a fix
              installed; and then a successful re-run of the test, the report would show a “fail”
              and “pass” result (and the supporting details), and not just the “pass”

  </appendix>

  <appendix title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment" id="entropyappendix"> 
  This appendix describes the required supplementary information for the entropy
  source used by the TOE.
  <h:br/>
  The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that, after
  reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why
  it can be relied upon to provide sufficient entropy. This documentation should
  include multiple detailed sections: design description, entropy justification,
  operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation is not required to
  be part of the TSS. 
   
<section id="entropydesign" title="Design Description">
  Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole,
  including the interaction of all entropy source components. Any information
  that can be shared regarding the design should also be included for any
  third-party entropy sources that are included in the product. 
  <h:br/>
  The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to
  include, how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be
  obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation
  should walk through the entropy source design indicating where the entropy
  comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any post-processing
  of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally,
  how it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the
  process (e.g., blocking) should also be described in the entropy source
  design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged. 
  <h:br/>
  This design must also include a description of the content of the
  security boundary of the entropy source and a description of how
  the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary
  cannot affect the entropy rate.
  <h:br/>
  If implemented, the design description shall include a description
  of how third-party applications can add entropy to the RBG. A
  description of any RBG state saving between power-off and
  power-on shall be included.
</section>

<section id="entropyjustification" title="Entropy Justification">
  There should be a technical argument for where the unpredictability in
  the source comes from and why there is confidence in the entropy source
  delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output
  (by this particular TOE). This argument will include a description of
  the expected min-entropy rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per
  bit or byte of source data) and explain that sufficient entropy is
  going into the TOE randomizer seeding process. This discussion will
  be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied
  upon to produce bits with entropy.
  <h:br/>
  The amount of information necessary to justify the expected
  min-entropy rate depends on the type of entropy source included in the
  product.
  <h:br/>
  For developer provided entropy sources, in order to justify the
  min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number of raw source
  bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the
  min-entropy rate determined from the statistical tests. While no
  particular statistical tests are required at this time, it is expected
  that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount of
  min-entropy in each output.
  <h:br/>
  For third party provided entropy sources, in which the TOE vendor
  has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the
  documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy
  obtained from this third-party source.  It is acceptable for the vendor
  to “assume” an amount of min-entropy, however, this assumption must be
  clearly stated in the documentation provided.  In particular, the
  min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included
  in the ST.
  <h:br/>
  Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also
  include how the DRBG is initialized with the entropy stated in the ST,

  <appendix id="equiv" title="Application Software Equivalency Guidelines">
    <section id="app-intro" title="Introduction">
      The purpose of equivalence in PP-based evaluations is to find a balance between evaluation rigor and commercial practicability—to 
      ensure that evaluations meet customer expectations while recognizing that there is little to be gained from requiring that every 
      variation in a product or platform be fully tested. If a product is found to be compliant with a PP on one platform, then all 
      equivalent products on equivalent platforms are also considered to be compliant with the PP.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      A Vendor can make a claim of equivalence if the Vendor believes that a particular instance of their Product implements PP-specified 
      security functionality in a way equivalent to the implementation of the same functionality on another instance of their Product on 
      which the functionality was tested. The Product instances can differ in version number or feature level (model), or the instances may
      run on different platforms. Equivalency can be used to reduce the testing required across claimed evaluated configurations. It can 
      also be used during Assurance Maintenance to reduce testing needed to add more evaluated configurations to a certification.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      These equivalency guidelines do not replace Assurance Maintenance requirements or NIAP Policy #5 requirements for CAVP certificates. 
      Nor may equivalency be used to leverage evaluations with expired certifications.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      These Equivalency Guidelines represent a shift from complete testing of all product instances to more of a risk-based approach. 
      Rather than require that every combination of product and platform be tested, these guidelines support an approach that recognizes
      that products are being used in a variety of environments—and often in cloud environments over where the vendor (and sometimes the 
      customer) have little or no control over the underlying hardware. Developers should be responsible for the security functionality of 
      their applications on the platforms they are developed for—whether that is an operating system, a virtual machine, or a software-based
      execution environment such as a container. But those platforms may themselves run within other environments—virtual machines or
      operating systems—that completely abstract away the underlying hardware from the application. The developer should not be held
      accountable for security functionality that is implemented by platform layers that are abstracted away. The implication is that
      not all security functionality will necessarily be tested for all platform layers down to the hardware for all evaluated
      configurations—especially for applications developed for software-based execution environments such as containers. For these cases, 
      the balancing of evaluation rigor and commercial practicability tips in favor of practicability. Note that this does not affect
      the requirement that at least one product instance be fully tested on at least one platform with cryptography mapped to a CAVP 
      certificate.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      Equivalency has two aspects:
      <h:br />
      <h:ol>
        <h:li><h:b><h:i>Product Equivalence:</h:i></h:b> Products may be considered equivalent if there are no
          differences between Product Models and Product Versions with respect to PP-specified security functionality.</h:li>
        <h:li><h:b><h:i>Platform Equivalence:</h:i></h:b> Platforms may be considered equivalent if there are no
          significant differences in the services they provide to the Product—or in the way the platforms 
          provide those services—with respect to PP-specified security functionality.</h:li>
      </h:ol>
      The equivalency determination is made in accordance with these guidelines by the Validator and Scheme using information provided by the Evaluator/Vendor.
    </section>
    <section id="approach" title="Approach to Equivalency Analysis">
      There are two scenarios for performing equivalency analysis. One is when a product has been certified and the vendor 
      wants to show that a later product should be considered certified due to equivalence with the earlier product. The 
      other is when multiple product variants are going though evaluation together and the vendor would like to reduce 
      the amount of testing that must be done. The basic rules for determining equivalence are the same in both cases. 
      But there is one additional consideration that applies to equivalence with previously certified products. That is, 
      the product with which equivalence is being claimed must have a valid certification in accordance with scheme rules
      and the Assurance Maintenance process must be followed. If a product’s certification has expired, then equivalence 
      cannot be claimed with that product.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      When performing equivalency analysis, the Evaluator/Vendor should first use the factors and guidelines for Product
      Model equivalence to determine the set of Product Models to be evaluated. In general, Product Models that do not differ 
      in PP-specified security functionality are considered equivalent for purposes of evaluation against the SWApp PP.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      If multiple revision levels of Product Models are to be evaluated—or to determine whether a revision of an evaluated 
      product needs re-evaluation—the Evaluator/Vendor and Validator should use the factors and guidelines for Product 
      Version equivalence to analyze whether Product Versions are equivalent.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      Having determined the set of Product Models and Versions to be evaluated, the next step is to determine the set of
      Platforms that the Products must be tested on.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      Each non-equivalent Product for which compliance is claimed must be fully tested on each non-equivalent platform 
      for which compliance is claimed. For non-equivalent Products on equivalent platforms, only the differences that
      affect PP-specified security functionality must be tested for each product.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      <h:b><h:i>“Differences in PP-Specified Security Functionality” Defined</h:i></h:b>
      <h:br />
      If PP-specified security functionality is implemented by the TOE, then differences in the actual implementation
      between versions or product models break equivalence for that feature. Likewise, if the TOE implements the 
      functionality in one version or model and the functionality is implemented by the platform in another version 
      or model, then equivalence is broken. If the functionality is implemented by the platform in multiple models or 
      versions on equivalent platforms, then the functionality is considered different if the product invokes the platform 
      differently to perform the function.
      
    </section>
    <section id="modelequiv" title="Specific Guidance for Determining Product Model Equivalence">
      Product Model equivalence attempts to determine whether different feature levels of the same product across 
      a product line are equivalent for purposes of PP testing. For example, if a product has a “basic” edition and an “enterprise” 
      edition, is it necessary to test both models? Or does testing one model provide sufficient assurance that both models 
      are compliant?
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      Product models are considered equivalent if there are no differences that affect PP-specified security 
      functionality—as indicated in Table 1.

    <section id="platformequiv" title="Specific Guidance for Determining Platform Equivalence">
      Platform equivalence is used to determine the platforms that equivalent versions of a Product must be tested on. 
      Platform equivalence analysis done for one software application cannot be applied to another software application.
      Platform equivalence is not general—it is with respect to a particular application. 
      <h:br /><h:br />
      Product Equivalency analysis must already have been done and Products have been determined to be equivalent.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      The platform can be hardware or virtual hardware, an operating system or similar entity, or a software execution 
      environment such as a container. For purposes of determining equivalence for software applications, we address each
      type of platform separately. In general, platform equivalence is based on differences in the interfaces between the 
      TOE and Platform that are relevant to the implementation of PP-specified security functionality.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      <subsection id="hardware-equiv" title="Platform Equivalence—Hardware/Virtual Hardware Platforms">
        If an Application runs directly on hardware without an operating system—or directly on virtualized 
        hardware without an operating system—then platform equivalence is based on processor architecture and 
        instruction sets. In the case of virtualized hardware, it is the virtualized processor and architecture 
        that are presented to the application that matters—not the physical hardware.
        <h:br /><h:br />
        Platforms with different processor architectures and instruction sets are not equivalent. This is not 
        likely to be an issue for equivalency analysis for applications since there is likely to be a different 
        version of the application for different hardware environments.
        Equivalency analysis becomes important when comparing processors with the same architecture. Processors 
        with the same architecture that have instruction sets that are subsets or supersets of each other are not
        disqualified from being equivalent for purposes of an App evaluation. If the application takes the same 
        code paths when executing PP-specified security functionality on different processors of the same family, 
        then the processors can be considered equivalent with respect to that application.
        For example, if an application follows one code path on platforms that support the AES-NI instruction 
        and another on platforms that do not, then those two platforms are not equivalent with respect to that 
        application functionality. But if the application follows the same code path whether or not the platform 
        supports AES-NI, then the platforms are equivalent with respect to that functionality.
        <h:br /><h:br />
        The platforms are equivalent with respect to the application if the platforms are equivalent with respect to all PP-specified
        security functionality.
