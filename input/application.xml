	<!-- 1.1 Overview -->
    <sec:Overview>The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to
		describe the security functionality of application software in terms of <xref g="CC"/>
		and to define functional and assurance requirements for such software. In recent years,
		software attacks have shifted from targeting operating systems to targeting applications. This
		has been the natural response to improvements in operating system security and development
		processes. As a result, it is paramount that the 
		security of applications be improved to
		reduce the risk of compromise.

	<!-- 1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation -->
    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
	
		The requirements in this document apply to application software which runs on any type of 
		platform. Some application types are covered by more specific PPs, which may be expressed as
		PP-Modules of this PP. Such applications are subject to the requirements of both this PP and the
		PP-Module that addresses their special functionality.  PPs for some 
		particularly specialized applications may not be expressed as PP-Modules at this time,
		though the requirements in this document should be seen as objectives for those 
		highly specialized applications.<h:p/>
		Although the requirements in this document apply to a wide range of application
		software, consult guidance from the relevant national schemes to
		determine when formal Common Criteria evaluation is expected for a
		particular type of application.  This may vary depending upon the nature
		of the security functionality of the application.

	<!-- 1.3.1 TOE Boundary -->
	<sec:TOE_Boundary>

		The application, which consists of the software provided by its vendor,
		is installed onto the platform(s) it operates on.  It executes on the platform, which
		may be an operating system (<xref to="toe-as-apponos"/>), hardware environment, 
	    a software based execution environment, or some combination of these (<xref to="toe-as-apponee"/>). 
		Those platforms may themselves run within other environments, such as virtual machines or operating 
		systems, that completely abstract away the underlying hardware from the application. The TOE is not 
		accountable for security functionality that is implemented by platform layers that are abstracted 
		away. Some evaluation activities are specific to the particular platform
		on which the application runs, in order to provide precision and
		repeatability. The only platforms currently recognized by the AppPP are those specified in SFR Evaluation Activities.
		To test on a platform for which there are no EAs, a Vendor should contact NIAP with recommended EAs.
		NIAP will determine if the proposed platform is appropriate for the PP and accept, reject,
		or develop EAs as necessary in coordination with the technical community.<h:p/>	
		Applications include a diverse range of software such as office suites, thin clients, PDF readers, downloadable
		smartphone apps, and apps running in a cloud container. The TOE includes 
		any software in the application installation package, even those pieces that may 
		extend or modify the functionality of the underlying platform, such as kernel drivers.  
		Many platforms come bundled with applications such as web browsers, email clients and media players and these too
		should be considered subject to the requirements defined in this document although the expectation of formal Common Criteria evaluation
		depends upon the national scheme.  BIOS and other firmware, the operating system kernel,
		and other systems software (and drivers) provided as part of the platform are outside the scope
		of this document.

		Requirements in this Protection Profile are designed to
		address the security problem in the following use cases. These use cases are intentionally
		very broad, as many specific use cases exist for application software. Many applications may

						<h:b>SP800-56A Key Establishment Schemes</h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluator shall verify a TOE's implementation of SP800-56A key agreement schemes 
						using the following Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key agreement 
						scheme verify that a TOE has implemented the components of the key agreement scheme 
						according to the specifications in the Recommendation. These components include the 
						calculation of the DLC primitives (the shared secret value Z) and the calculation of the 
						derived keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation 
						is supported, the evaluator shall also verify that the components of key confirmation have 
						been implemented correctly, using the test procedures described below. This includes the 
						parsing of the DKM, the generation of MACdata and the calculation of MACtag. <h:p/>
						<h:b>Function Test</h:b><h:p/>
						The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement 
						schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors 
						from a known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each supported 
						key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type, and, if supported, 
						key confirmation role- key confirmation type combination, the tester shall generate 10 
						sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain parameter values (FFC) or 
						the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, 
						ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being tested.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static and/or 
						ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other 
						Information <h:i>(OtherInfo)</h:i> and TOE id fields. <h:p/>
						If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator shall obtain only 
						the public keys and the hashed value of the shared secret.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given 
						scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value, 
						derive the keying material DKM, and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from 
						these values. <h:p/>
						If key confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each implemented 
						approved MAC algorithm. <h:p/>
						<h:b>Validity Test</h:b><h:p/>
						The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid and 
						invalid key agreement results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this test, the 
						evaluator shall obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions included in the 
						SP800-56A key agreement implementation to determine which errors the TOE should 
						be able to recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors 
						consisting of data sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves, the 
						evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s public/private key pairs, MACTag, and any inputs 
						used in the KDF, such as the OtherInfo and TOE id fields. <h:p/>
						The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE 
						recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: 
						the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the OtherInfo field, the data to be 
						MACed, or the generated MACTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial (only ECC) 
						public key validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors in both parties’ 
						static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the TOE’s static private key 
						to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key validation function and/or the partial 
						key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test vectors shall remain 
						unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results (they should pass).<h:p/>
						The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme 
						using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results with 
						the results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects these errors.<h:p/>

						The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes whether the TOE acts as a sender, a 
						recipient, or both for RSA-based key establishment schemes. <h:p/>

						<h:div class="indent">

					<Tests>
						The evaluator shall perform all of the following tests for each algorithm implemented by the TSF and used to
						satisfy the requirements of this PP:<h:p/>
						<h:b>AES-CBC Known Answer Tests</h:b><h:p/>
						There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs), described below. In all KATs, the plaintext, ciphertext, and IV values shall be 128-bit
						blocks. The results from each test may either be obtained by the
						evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer
						and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness,
						the evaluator shall compare the resulting values to those obtained
						by submitting the same inputs to a known good implementation. <h:ul>
							<h:li>KAT-1. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the
								evaluator shall supply a set of 10 plaintext values and obtain
								the ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC encryption of the
								given plaintext using a key value of all zeros and an IV of all
								zeros. Five plaintext values shall be encrypted with a 128-bit
								all-zeros key, and the other five shall be encrypted with a
								256-bit all- zeros key. To test the decrypt functionality of
								AES-CBC, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for
								encrypt, using 10 ciphertext values as input and AES-CBC
								decryption.</h:li>
							<h:li>KAT-2. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the
								evaluator shall supply a set of 10 key values and obtain the
								ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC encryption of an
								all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of all
								zeros. Five of the keys shall be 128-bit keys, and the other five
								shall be 256-bit keys. To test the decrypt functionality of
								AES-CBC, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for
								encrypt, using an all-zero ciphertext value as input and AES-CBC
								decryption.</h:li>
							<h:li>KAT-3. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the
								evaluator shall supply the two sets of key values described below
								and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES encryption
								of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of
								all zeros. The first set of keys shall have 128 128-bit keys, and
								the second set shall have 256 256-bit keys. Key i in each set
								shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits
								be zeros, for i in [1,N]. To test the decrypt functionality of
								AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply the two sets of key and
								ciphertext value pairs described below and obtain the plaintext
								value that results from AES-CBC decryption of the given
								ciphertext using the given key and an IV of all zeros. The first
								set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 128 128-bit key/ciphertext
								pairs, and the second set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 256
								256-bit key/ciphertext pairs. Key i in each set shall have the
								leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for
								i in [1,N]. The ciphertext value in each pair shall be the value
								that results in an all-zeros plaintext when decrypted with its
								corresponding key.</h:li>
							<h:li>KAT-4. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the
								evaluator shall supply the set of 128 plaintext values described
								below and obtain the two ciphertext values that result from
								AES-CBC encryption of the given plaintext using a 128-bit key
								value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros and using a 256-bit
								key value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros, respectively.
								Plaintext value i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be
								ones and the rightmost 128-i bits be zeros, for i in
								[1,128].</h:li>
						</h:ul>To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator
						shall perform the same test as for encrypt, using ciphertext values
						of the same form as the plaintext in the encrypt test as input and
						AES-CBC decryption. <h:p/>
						<h:b>AES-CBC Multi-Block Message Test</h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality by
						encrypting an i-block message where 1 &lt; i &lt;= 10. The
						evaluator shall choose a key, an IV and plaintext message of length
						i blocks and encrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with
						the chosen key and IV. The ciphertext shall be compared to the
						result of encrypting the same plaintext message with the same key
						and IV using a known good implementation. The evaluator shall also
						test the decrypt functionality for each mode by decrypting an
						i-block message where 1 &lt; i &lt;=10. The evaluator shall choose
						a key, an IV and a ciphertext message of length i blocks and
						decrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with the chosen
						key and IV. The plaintext shall be compared to the result of
						decrypting the same ciphertext message with the same key and IV
						using a known good implementation. AES-CBC Monte Carlo Tests The
						evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using a set of 200
						plaintext, IV, and key 3- tuples. 100 of these shall use 128 bit
						keys, and 100 shall use 256 bit keys. The plaintext and IV values
						shall be 128-bit blocks. For each 3-tuple, 1000 iterations shall be
						run as follows: 
						  <h:pre>
						  # Input: PT, IV, Key
						  for i = 1 to 1000:
							if i == 1:
								  CT[1] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, IV, PT)
								  PT = IV
							else:
							  CT[i] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, PT) 
							  PT = CT[i-1]
						  </h:pre>
						The ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration (i.e.,
						CT[1000]) is the result for that trial. This result shall be
						compared to the result of running 1000 iterations with the same
						values using a known good implementation.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality using the
						same test as for encrypt, exchanging CT and PT and replacing
						AES-CBC-Encrypt with AES-CBC-Decrypt. <h:p/>
						<h:b>AES-GCM Monte Carlo Tests</h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluator shall test the authenticated encrypt
						functionality of AES-GCM for each combination of the following
						input parameter lengths: <h:ul>
							<h:li>128 bit and 256 bit keys</h:li>
							<h:li>Two plaintext lengths. One of the plaintext lengths shall be
								a non-zero integer multiple of 128 bits, if
								supported. The other plaintext length shall not be an integer
								multiple of 128 bits, if supported.</h:li>
							<h:li>Three AAD lengths. One AAD length shall be 0, if supported.
								One AAD length shall be a non-zero integer
								multiple of 128 bits, if supported. One AAD length shall not be
								an integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported.</h:li>
							<h:li>Two IV lengths. If 96 bit IV is supported, 96 bits shall be
								one of the two IV lengths tested.</h:li>
						</h:ul>The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using a set
						of 10 key, plaintext, AAD, and IV tuples for each combination of
						parameter lengths above and obtain the ciphertext value and tag
						that results from AES-GCM authenticated encrypt. Each supported tag
						length shall be tested at least once per set of 10. The IV value
						may be supplied by the evaluator or the implementation being
						tested, as long as it is known. <h:p/>
						The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality using a
						set of 10 key, ciphertext, tag, AAD, and IV 5-tuples for each
						combination of parameter lengths above and obtain a Pass/Fail
						result on authentication and the decrypted plaintext if Pass. The
						set shall include five tuples that Pass and five that Fail.<h:p/>
						The results from each test may either be obtained by the
						evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer
						and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness,
						the evaluator shall compare the resulting values to those obtained
						by submitting the same inputs to a known good
						implementation.<h:p/>
						<h:b>AES-XTS Tests</h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality of XTS-AES for each combination
						of the following input parameter lengths:<h:p/>
						256 bit (for AES-128) and 512 bit (for AES-256) keys<h:p/>
						Three data unit (i.e., plaintext) lengths. One of the data unit lengths shall be a
						non-zero integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. One of the data unit lengths
						shall be an integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. The third data unit length
						shall be either the longest supported data unit length or 216 bits, whichever is
						smaller.<h:p/>
						Using a set of 100 (key, plaintext and 128-bit random tweak value) 3-tuples and
						obtain the ciphertext that results from XTS-AES encrypt.<h:p/>
						The evaluator may supply a data unit sequence number instead of the tweak value if
						the implementation supports it. The data unit sequence number is a base-10 number
						ranging between 0 and 255 that implementations convert to a tweak value internally.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality of XTS-AES using the same test as
						for encrypt, replacing plaintext values with ciphertext values and XTS-AES encrypt
						with XTS-AES decrypt.<h:p/>
						<h:b>AES-CCM Tests</h:b>
						It is not recommended that evaluators use values obtained from static sources such as
						http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/mac/ccmtestvectors.zip or use values not generated expressly
						to exercise the AES-CCM implementation.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall test the generation-encryption and decryption-verification functionality of AES-CCM for
						the following input parameter and tag lengths:<h:ul>
							<h:li>Keys: All supported and selected key sizes (e.g., 128, 256 bits).</h:li>
							<h:li>Associated Data: Two or three values for associated data length: The minimum (≥ 0 bytes) and 
								maximum (≤ 32 bytes) supported associated data lengths, and 2^16 (65536) bytes, if supported.</h:li>
							<h:li>Payload: Two values for payload length: The minimum (≥ 0 bytes) and maximum (≤ 32 bytes) supported 
								payload lengths.</h:li>
							<h:li>Nonces: All supported nonce lengths (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13) in bytes.</h:li>
							<h:li>Tag: All supported tag lengths (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16) in bytes.</h:li>
						</h:ul>
						The testing for CCM consists of five tests. To determine correctness in each of the below tests, the evaluator
						shall compare the ciphertext with the result of encryption of the same inputs with a known good implementation.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Variable Associated Data Test</h:b><h:p/>
						For each supported key size and associated data length, and any supported payload length, nonce length, and tag 
						length, the evaluator shall supply one key value, one nonce value, and 10 pairs of associated data and payload 
						values, and obtain the resulting ciphertext.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Variable Payload Test</h:b><h:p/>
						For each supported key size and payload length, and any supported associated data length, nonce length, and tag 
						length, the evaluator shall supply one key value, one nonce value, and 10 pairs of associated data and payload 
						values, and obtain the resulting ciphertext.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Variable Nonce Test</h:b><h:p/>
						For each supported key size and nonce length, and any supported associated data length, payload length, and tag 
						length, the evaluator shall supply one key value, one nonce value, and 10 pairs of associated data and payload
						values, and obtain the resulting ciphertext.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Variable Tag Test</h:b><h:p/>
						For each supported key size and tag length, and any supported associated data length, payload length, and nonce 
						length, the evaluator shall supply one key value, one nonce value, and 10 pairs of associated data and payload 
						values, and obtain the resulting ciphertext.<h:p/>
						<h:b>Decryption-Verification Process Test</h:b><h:p/>
						To test the decryption-verification functionality of AES-CCM, for each combination of supported associated data
						length, payload length, nonce length, and tag length, the evaluator shall supply a key value and 15 sets of input 
						plus ciphertext, and obtain the decrypted payload. Ten of the 15 input sets supplied should fail verification and
						five should pass.<h:p/>
						<h:b>AES-CTR Tests</h:b><h:p/>
						<h:b><h:i>Test 1: Known Answer Tests (KATs)</h:i></h:b><h:p/>
						There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs) described below. For all KATs, the plaintext, IV, and ciphertext values 
						shall be 128-bit blocks. The results from each test may either be obtained by the validator directly or by
						supplying the inputs to the implementer and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness, the 
						evaluator shall compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the same inputs to a known good
						implementation.<h:p/>
						To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply a set of 10 plaintext values and obtain the
						ciphertext value that results from encryption of the given plaintext using a key value of all zeros and an IV of
						all zeros. Five plaintext values shall be encrypted with a 128-bit all zeros key, and the other five shall be 
						encrypted with a 256-bit all zeros key. To test the decrypt functionality, the evaluator shall perform the same 
						test as for encrypt, using 10 ciphertext values as input.<h:p/>
						To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply a set of 10 key values and obtain the ciphertext 
						value that results from encryption of an all zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of all zeros.
						Five of the key values shall be 128-bit keys, and the other five shall be 256-bit keys. To test the decrypt 
						functionality, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for encrypt, using an all zero ciphertext value as 
						input.<h:p/>
						To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply the two sets of key values described below and 
						obtain the ciphertext values that result from AES encryption of an all zeros plaintext using the given key values
						an an IV of all zeros. The first set of keys shall have 128 128-bit keys, and the second shall have 256 256-bit 
						keys. Key_i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i
						in [1, N]. To test the decrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply the two sets of key and ciphertext
						value pairs described below and obtain the plaintext value that results from decryption of the given ciphertext
						using the given key values and an IV of all zeros. The first set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 128 128-bit
						key/ciphertext pairs, and the second set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 256 256-bit pairs. Key_i in each
						set shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros for i in [1, N]. The ciphertext
						value in each pair shall be the value that results in an all zeros plaintext when decrypted with its corresponding
						key.<h:p/>
						To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply the set of 128 plaintext values described below and 
						obtain the two ciphertext values that result from encryption of the given plaintext using a 128-bit key value of 
						all zeros and using a 256 bit key value of all zeros, respectively, and an IV of all zeros. Plaintext value i in
						each set shall have the leftmost bits be ones and the rightmost 128-i bits be zeros, for i in [1, 128]. To test
						the decrypt functionality, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for encrypt, using ciphertext values of
						the same form as the plaintext in the encrypt test as input.<h:p/>
						<h:b><h:i>Test 2: Multi-Block Message Test</h:i></h:b><h:p/>
						The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality by encrypting an i-block message where 1 less-than i 
						less-than-or-equal to 10. For each i the evaluator shall choose a key, IV, and plaintext message of length i 
						blocks and encrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with the chosen key. The ciphertext shall be compared 
						to the result of encrypting the same plaintext message with the same key and IV using a known good implementation.
						The evaluator shall also test the decrypt functionality by decrypting an i-block message where 1 less-than i 
						less-than-or-equal to 10. For each i the evaluator shall choose a key and a ciphertext message of length i blocks 
						and decrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with the chosen key. The plaintext shall be compared to the
						result of decrypting the same ciphertext message with the same key using a known good implementation.<h:p/>
						<h:b><h:i>Test 3: Monte-Carlo Test</h:i></h:b><h:p/>
						For AES-CTR mode perform the Monte Carlo Test for ECB Mode on the encryption engine of the counter mode
						implementation. There is no need to test the decryption engine.<h:p/>
						The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using 200 plaintext/key pairs. 100 of these shall use 128 bit 
						keys, and 100 of these shall use 256 bit keys. The plaintext values shall be 128-bit blocks. For each pair, 
						1000 iterations shall be run as follows:<h:p/>
						<h:code>
							For AES-ECB mode
							   # Input: PT, Key              
							   for i = 1 to 1000:
								  CT[i] = AES-ECB-Encrypt(Key, PT)
								  PT = CT[i]
						</h:code><h:p/>
						The ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration is the result for that trial. This result shall be compared to
						the result of running 1000 iterations with the same values using a known good implementation.<h:p/>

						The TSF hashing functions can be implemented in one of two

						hashes only messages that are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e., the length 
						(in bits) of the message to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is the 
						bit-oriented mode. In this mode the TSF hashes messages of arbitrary 
						length. As there are different tests for each mode, an indication is given in the 
						following sections for the bit-oriented vs. the byte-oriented test MACs. The evaluator 
						shall perform all of the following tests for each hash algorithm implemented by the

						The following tests require the developer to provide access to a test application
						that provides the evaluator with tools that are typically not found in the production application.
						<testlist>
							<test>Short Messages Test - Bit oriented Mode. The evaluators devise an input set
								consisting of m+1 messages, where m is the block length of the hash algorithm. The
								length of the messages range sequentially from 0 to m bits. The message text shall
								be pseudorandomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for each of

								provided to the TSF. </test>
							<test>Short Messages Test - Byte oriented Mode. The evaluators devise an input set

								The length of the ith message is 512 + 99*i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ m. The message text
								shall be pseudorandomly generated. The evaluators compute the message digest for

					The intent is for the evaluator to ensure that the selection captures all
					hardware resources which the application accesses, and that these are 
					restricted to those which are justified.
					On some platforms, the application must explicitly solicit permission 
					in order to access hardware resources.
					Seeking such permissions, even if the application does not later make use of the
					hardware resource, should still be considered access.
					Selections should be expressed in a manner consistent with how the application expresses
					its access needs to the underlying platform.  For example,
					the platform may provide location services which implies the potential use of a variety
					of hardware resources (e.g. satellite receivers, WiFi, cellular radio)
					yet "<h:i>location services</h:i>" is the proper selection.  This is because use of these resources
					can be inferred, but also because the actual usage may vary based on the particular platform.
					Resources that do not need to be explicitly identified are
					those which are ordinarily used by any application such as central processing units,
					main memory, displays, input devices (e.g. keyboards, mice), and
					persistent storage devices provided by the platform.

    <section title="Security Assurance Requirements" id="SARs">
	
		The Security Objectives for the TOE in <xref to="req"/> were constructed to address threats identified in
		<xref to="Threats"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) in <xref to="SFRs"/> are a formal
		instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP identifies the Security Assurance Requirements
		(SARs) to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation 
		and performs independent testing.<h:p/>
		This section lists the set of SARs from CC part 3 that are required in evaluations against this
		PP. Individual Evaluation Activities (EAs) to be performed are specified both
		in <xref to="req"/> as well as in this section. <h:p/>      
		The general model for evaluation of TOEs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows:<h:p/>
		After the ST has been approved for evaluation, the  CCTL will obtain the TOE, supporting
		environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for the TOE. The CCTL is expected to
		perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and
		ALC SARs. The CCTL also performs the evaluation activities contained within <xref to="req"/>,
		which are intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM assurance requirements as they
		apply to the specific technology instantiated in the TOE. The evaluation activities that are
		captured in <xref to="req"/> also provide clarification as to what the developer needs
		to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant with the PP. The results of these activities will be documented
	    and presented (along with the administrative guidance used) for validation.

    <section title="Class ADV: Development" id="adv">The information about the TOE
        is contained in the guidance documentation available to the end user as
        well as the TSS portion of the ST. The TOE developer 
        must concur with the description of the product that is contained in the TSS as it relates 
        to the functional requirements. The evaluation activities contained in 
        <xref to="SFRs"/> should provide the ST authors with sufficient information to 
        determine the appropriate content for the TSS section. 
        <a-component cc-id="adv_fsp.1" name="Basic Functional Specification (ADV_FSP.1)">The functional
			specification describes the TSFIs. It is not necessary
			to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally, because
            TOEs conforming to this PP will necessarily have interfaces to the
			Operational Environment that are not directly invocable by TOE users, 
			there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of themselves 
			since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP, the 
			activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in the 
			TSS in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces 
			presented in the AGD documentation. No additional “functional specification” documentation 
			is necessary to satisfy the evaluation activities specified. The interfaces that need to be 
			evaluated are characterized through the information needed to perform the assurance 
			activities listed, rather than as an independent, abstract list.

					as well as the test procedures to be followed to achieve those objectives. These
					procedures include expected results. <h:p/>
					The test report (which could just be an annotated
					version of the test plan) details the activities that took place when the test
					procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the tests. This shall be
					a cumulative account, so if there was a test run that resulted in a failure; a fix

  <appendix title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment" id="entropyappendix"> 
  This appendix describes the required supplementary information for the entropy
  source used by the TOE.
  <h:br/>
  The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that, after
  reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why
  it can be relied upon to provide sufficient entropy. This documentation should
  include multiple detailed sections: design description, entropy justification,
  operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation is not required to
  be part of the TSS. 
   
<section id="entropydesign" title="Design Description">
  Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole,
  including the interaction of all entropy source components. Any information
  that can be shared regarding the design should also be included for any
  third-party entropy sources that are included in the product. 
  <h:br/>
  The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to
  include, how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be
  obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation
  should walk through the entropy source design indicating where the entropy
  comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any post-processing
  of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally,
  how it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the
  process (e.g., blocking) should also be described in the entropy source
  design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged. 
  <h:br/>
  This design must also include a description of the content of the
  security boundary of the entropy source and a description of how
  the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary
  cannot affect the entropy rate.
  <h:br/>
  If implemented, the design description shall include a description
  of how third-party applications can add entropy to the RBG. A
  description of any RBG state saving between power-off and
  power-on shall be included.
</section>

<section id="entropyjustification" title="Entropy Justification">
  There should be a technical argument for where the unpredictability in
  the source comes from and why there is confidence in the entropy source
  delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output
  (by this particular TOE). This argument will include a description of
  the expected min-entropy rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per
  bit or byte of source data) and explain that sufficient entropy is
  going into the TOE randomizer seeding process. This discussion will
  be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied
  upon to produce bits with entropy.
  <h:br/>
  The amount of information necessary to justify the expected
  min-entropy rate depends on the type of entropy source included in the
  product.
  <h:br/>
  For developer provided entropy sources, in order to justify the
  min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number of raw source
  bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the
  min-entropy rate determined from the statistical tests. While no
  particular statistical tests are required at this time, it is expected
  that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount of
  min-entropy in each output.
  <h:br/>
  For third party provided entropy sources, in which the TOE vendor
  has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the
  documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy
  obtained from this third-party source.  It is acceptable for the vendor
  to “assume” an amount of min-entropy, however, this assumption must be
  clearly stated in the documentation provided.  In particular, the
  min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included
  in the ST.
  <h:br/>
  Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also
  include how the DRBG is initialized with the entropy stated in the ST,
  for example by verifying that the min-entropy rate is multiplied by the
  amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of entropy
  expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and
  compared to the statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to
  seed the DRBG is not clear or the calculated rate is not explicitly
  related to the seed, the documentation will not be considered complete.
  <h:br/>
  The entropy justification shall not include any data added from
  any third-party application or from any state saving between restarts.
</section>

<section id="entropyoperatingconditions" title="Operating Conditions">
  The entropy rate may be affected by conditions outside the control
  of the entropy source itself.  For example, voltage, frequency,
  temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the
  factors that may affect the operation of the entropy source.
  As such, documentation will also include the range of operating conditions
  under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data.
  It will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the
  system design to ensure the entropy source continues to operate
  under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall describe
  the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction
  or become inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation
  of the source shall be included.
</section>

<section id="entropyhealthtesting" title="Health Testing">
  More specifically, all entropy source health tests and their rationale
  will be documented. This will include a description of the health tests,
  the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed
  (e.g., at startup, continuously, or on-demand), the expected results
  for each health test, and rationale indicating why each test is
  believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in the
  entropy source.

  <appendix id="equiv" title="Application Software Equivalency Guidelines">
    <section id="app-intro" title="Introduction">
      The purpose of equivalence in PP-based evaluations is to find a balance between evaluation rigor and commercial practicability—to 
      ensure that evaluations meet customer expectations while recognizing that there is little to be gained from requiring that every 
      variation in a product or platform be fully tested. If a product is found to be compliant with a PP on one platform, then all 
      equivalent products on equivalent platforms are also considered to be compliant with the PP.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      A Vendor can make a claim of equivalence if the Vendor believes that a particular instance of their Product implements PP-specified 
      security functionality in a way equivalent to the implementation of the same functionality on another instance of their Product on 
      which the functionality was tested. The Product instances can differ in version number or feature level (model), or the instances may
      run on different platforms. Equivalency can be used to reduce the testing required across claimed evaluated configurations. It can 
      also be used during Assurance Maintenance to reduce testing needed to add more evaluated configurations to a certification.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      These equivalency guidelines do not replace Assurance Maintenance requirements or NIAP Policy #5 requirements for CAVP certificates. 
      Nor may equivalency be used to leverage evaluations with expired certifications.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      These Equivalency Guidelines represent a shift from complete testing of all product instances to more of a risk-based approach. 
      Rather than require that every combination of product and platform be tested, these guidelines support an approach that recognizes
      that products are being used in a variety of environments—and often in cloud environments over where the vendor (and sometimes the 
      customer) have little or no control over the underlying hardware. Developers should be responsible for the security functionality of 
      their applications on the platforms they are developed for—whether that is an operating system, a virtual machine, or a software-based
      execution environment such as a container. But those platforms may themselves run within other environments—virtual machines or
      operating systems—that completely abstract away the underlying hardware from the application. The developer should not be held
      accountable for security functionality that is implemented by platform layers that are abstracted away. The implication is that
      not all security functionality will necessarily be tested for all platform layers down to the hardware for all evaluated
      configurations—especially for applications developed for software-based execution environments such as containers. For these cases, 
      the balancing of evaluation rigor and commercial practicability tips in favor of practicability. Note that this does not affect
      the requirement that at least one product instance be fully tested on at least one platform with cryptography mapped to a CAVP 
      certificate.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      Equivalency has two aspects:
      <h:br />
      <h:ol>
        <h:li><h:b><h:i>Product Equivalence:</h:i></h:b> Products may be considered equivalent if there are no
          differences between Product Models and Product Versions with respect to PP-specified security functionality.</h:li>
        <h:li><h:b><h:i>Platform Equivalence:</h:i></h:b> Platforms may be considered equivalent if there are no
          significant differences in the services they provide to the Product—or in the way the platforms 
          provide those services—with respect to PP-specified security functionality.</h:li>
      </h:ol>
      The equivalency determination is made in accordance with these guidelines by the Validator and Scheme using information provided by the Evaluator/Vendor.
    </section>
    <section id="approach" title="Approach to Equivalency Analysis">
      There are two scenarios for performing equivalency analysis. One is when a product has been certified and the vendor 
      wants to show that a later product should be considered certified due to equivalence with the earlier product. The 
      other is when multiple product variants are going though evaluation together and the vendor would like to reduce 
      the amount of testing that must be done. The basic rules for determining equivalence are the same in both cases. 
      But there is one additional consideration that applies to equivalence with previously certified products. That is, 
      the product with which equivalence is being claimed must have a valid certification in accordance with scheme rules
      and the Assurance Maintenance process must be followed. If a product’s certification has expired, then equivalence 
      cannot be claimed with that product.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      When performing equivalency analysis, the Evaluator/Vendor should first use the factors and guidelines for Product
      Model equivalence to determine the set of Product Models to be evaluated. In general, Product Models that do not differ 
      in PP-specified security functionality are considered equivalent for purposes of evaluation against the AppPP.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      If multiple revision levels of Product Models are to be evaluated—or to determine whether a revision of an evaluated 
      product needs re-evaluation—the Evaluator/Vendor and Validator should use the factors and guidelines for Product 
      Version equivalence to analyze whether Product Versions are equivalent.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      Having determined the set of Product Models and Versions to be evaluated, the next step is to determine the set of
      Platforms that the Products must be tested on.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      Each non-equivalent Product for which compliance is claimed must be fully tested on each non-equivalent platform 
      for which compliance is claimed. For non-equivalent Products on equivalent platforms, only the differences that
      affect PP-specified security functionality must be tested for each product.
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      <h:b><h:i>“Differences in PP-Specified Security Functionality” Defined</h:i></h:b>
      <h:br />
      If PP-specified security functionality is implemented by the TOE, then differences in the actual implementation
      between versions or product models break equivalence for that feature. Likewise, if the TOE implements the 
      functionality in one version or model and the functionality is implemented by the platform in another version 
      or model, then equivalence is broken. If the functionality is implemented by the platform in multiple models or 
      versions on equivalent platforms, then the functionality is considered different if the product invokes the platform 
      differently to perform the function.
      
    </section>
    <section id="modelequiv" title="Specific Guidance for Determining Product Model Equivalence">
      Product Model equivalence attempts to determine whether different feature levels of the same product across 
      a product line are equivalent for purposes of PP testing. For example, if a product has a “basic” edition and an “enterprise” 
      edition, is it necessary to test both models? Or does testing one model provide sufficient assurance that both models 
      are compliant?
      <h:br />
      <h:br />
      Product models are considered equivalent if there are no differences that affect PP-specified security 
      functionality—as indicated in Table 1.

    <section id="platformequiv" title="Specific Guidance for Determining Platform Equivalence">
      Platform equivalence is used to determine the platforms that equivalent versions of a Product must be tested on. 
      Platform equivalence analysis done for one software application cannot be applied to another software application.
      Platform equivalence is not general—it is with respect to a particular application. 
      <h:br /><h:br />
      Product Equivalency analysis must already have been done and Products have been determined to be equivalent.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      The platform can be hardware or virtual hardware, an operating system or similar entity, or a software execution 
      environment such as a container. For purposes of determining equivalence for software applications, we address each
      type of platform separately. In general, platform equivalence is based on differences in the interfaces between the 
      TOE and Platform that are relevant to the implementation of PP-specified security functionality.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      <section id="hardware-equiv" title="Platform Equivalence—Hardware/Virtual Hardware Platforms">
        If an Application runs directly on hardware without an operating system—or directly on virtualized 
        hardware without an operating system—then platform equivalence is based on processor architecture and 
        instruction sets. In the case of virtualized hardware, it is the virtualized processor and architecture 
        that are presented to the application that matters—not the physical hardware.
        <h:br /><h:br />
        Platforms with different processor architectures and instruction sets are not equivalent. This is not 
        likely to be an issue for equivalency analysis for applications since there is likely to be a different 
        version of the application for different hardware environments.
        Equivalency analysis becomes important when comparing processors with the same architecture. Processors 
        with the same architecture that have instruction sets that are subsets or supersets of each other are not
        disqualified from being equivalent for purposes of an App evaluation. If the application takes the same 
        code paths when executing PP-specified security functionality on different processors of the same family, 
        then the processors can be considered equivalent with respect to that application.
        For example, if an application follows one code path on platforms that support the AES-NI instruction 
        and another on platforms that do not, then those two platforms are not equivalent with respect to that 
        application functionality. But if the application follows the same code path whether or not the platform 
        supports AES-NI, then the platforms are equivalent with respect to that functionality.
        <h:br /><h:br />
        The platforms are equivalent with respect to the application if the platforms are equivalent with respect to all PP-specified
        security functionality.

    <section id="specificity" title="Level of Specificity for Tested Configurations and Claimed Equivalent Configurations">
      In order to make equivalency determinations, the vendor and evaluator must agree on the equivalency claims. They must 
      then provide the scheme with sufficient information about the TOE instances and platforms that were evaluated, and the 
      TOE instances and platforms that are claimed to be equivalent.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      The ST must describe all configurations evaluated down to processor manufacturer, model number, and microarchitecture version. 
      <h:br /><h:br />
      The information regarding claimed equivalent configurations depends on the platform that the application was developed for and runs on.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      <h:b>Bare-Metal Applications</h:b>
      <h:br /><h:br />
      For applications that run without an operating system on bare-metal or virtual bare-metal, the claimed configuration must 
      describe the platform down to the specific processor manufacturer, model number, and microarchitecture version. The Vendor
      must describe the differences in the TOE with respect to PP-specified security functionality and how the TOE functions
      differently to leverage platform differences (e.g., instruction set extensions) in the tested configuration versus the 
      claimed equivalent configuration. 
      <h:br /><h:br />
      <h:b>Traditional Applications</h:b>
      <h:br /><h:br />
      For applications that run with an operating system as their immediate platform, the claimed configuration must describe 
      the platform down to the specific operating system version. If the platform is a virtualization system, then the claimed 
      configuration must describe the platform down to the specific virtualization system version. The Vendor must describe the 
      differences in the TOE with respect to PP-specified security functionality and how the TOE functions differently to leverage
      platform differences in the tested configuration versus the claimed equivalent configuration. Relevant platform differences 
      could include instruction sets, device interfaces, and OS APIs invoked by the TOE to implement PP-specified security 
      functionality.
      <h:br /><h:br />
      <h:b>Software-Based Execution Environments</h:b>
      <h:br /><h:br />
      For applications that run in a software-based execution environment such as a Java virtual machine or a Container, then 
      the claimed configuration must describe the platform down to the specific version of the software execution environment. 
      The Vendor must describe the differences in the TOE with respect to PP-specified security functionality and how the TOE 
      functions differently to leverage platform differences in the tested configuration versus the claimed equivalent 
      configuration.
