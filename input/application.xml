			<section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">
				The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to describe the
				functionality of application software in terms of
				<cite linkend="bibCC" />
				and to define functional and assurance requirements for such
				software. In recent years, software attacks have shifted from
				targeting operating systems to targeting applications. This has been
				the natural response to improvements in operating system security
				and development processes. As a result, it is paramount that the
				security of applications be improved to reduce the risk to client
				systems and enterprise networks. The requirements in this
				PP are intended to improve the security of
				applications by ensuring that they take advantage of operating
				system security services, environmental mitigations, and underlying
				hardware. Additionally, these requirements attempt to define
				acceptable behavior for applications regardless of the security
				features provided by the operating system.
			</section>
			<section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
				The requirements in this document apply to all application software
				that runs on any operating system - regardless of the function of
				the application, identity of the operating system, or composition of
				the underlying platform. For purposes of this document, an
				application is defined as software that runs on an operating system
				and performs tasks on behalf of the user or owner of the platform.
				As distinguished from applications, operating system software
				manages platform resources and provides services for applications.
				Applications that come bundled with an operating system (such as web
				browsers, email clients and media players) fall within the scope of
				these requirements. Naturally, third-party software such as 
				PDF readers and downloadable smart-phone apps is also
				in scope. Systems software that is delivered and installed with an
				application (such as kernel drivers) is considered part of the
				application for purposes of this document. BIOS and other firmware,
				the operating system kernel, and other systems software (and
				drivers) that are included with the computing platform are
				outside the scope of this document. System services - even if they
				run with user-level privileges - are considered to be part of the
				operating system, and are thus also out of scope. Some application
				types are covered by more specific PPs which are expressed as
				Extended Packages of this PP.  Such
				applications are subject to both this PP and
				the PP that addresses their special functionality. For example, web browsers
				are subject to the requirements in both this PP
				and the Protection Profile for Web Browsers.

			<section title="Security Assurance Requirements" id="secSAR">
The Security Objectives for the TOE in Section 4 were constructed to address threats
The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) in Sections 4 are a formal 
instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP draws from EAL1 the Security Assurance Requirements 
(SARs) to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the 
evaluation and performs independent testing. 
<br/>
While this section contains the complete set of SARs from the CC, the Assurance Activities to be 
performed by an evaluator are detailed in Section 4 as well as in this section. 
The general model for evaluation of TOEs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows: 
<br/>
After the ST has been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF will obtain the TOE, supporting environmental 
IT, and the administrative guides for the TOE. The Assurance Activities listed in the ST (which will be 
refined by the ITSEF to be TOE-specific, either within the ST or in a separate document) will then be 
performed by the ITSEF. The ITSEF is also expected to perform all of the actions mandated by the 
Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) for EAL1. The results of these activities will be documented 
and presented (along with the administrative guidance used) for validation. 
<br/>
For each family, "Developer Notes" are provided on the developer action elements to clarify what, if 
any, additional documentation/activity needs to be provided by the developer. For the 
content/presentation and evaluator activity elements, additional assurance activities (to those already 
contained in Sections 4 and the CEM for EAL1) are described as a whole for the family
rather than for each element. Additionally, the assurance activities described in this section are 
complementary to those specified in Section 5. 
<br/>
The TOE security assurance requirements, summarized in the table below, identify the management and 
evaluative activities required to meet the objectives identified in Section 4 of this PP.

		<SO id="O.INTEGRITY">
			<description>To maintain their own integrity, conformant TOEs
				ensure the integrity of their installation and
				update packages, and also leverage execution environment-based mitigations.
				Software is seldom if ever shipped without errors, and the ability
				to deploy patches and updates to fielded software with integrity is critical to
				enterprise network security.  Processor manufacturers, compiler
				developers, and operating system vendors have developed execution
				environment-based mitigations that increase the cost to attackers
				by adding complexity to the task of compromising systems.
				Application software can often take advantage of these mechanisms by
				using APIs provided by the operating system or by enabling the
				mechanism through compiler or linker options.

		<SO id="O.QUALITY">
			<description>To ensure quality of implementation, conformant TOEs leverage
				services and APIs provided by the operating system rather than
				implementing their own versions of these services and APIs. This is

				operations such as file and media parsing.  Quality of implementation includes
				maintaining compatibility with future operating system
				versions and updates by using only documented and supported APIs.

To address the issue of loss of confidentiality of user data in the event of loss of physical control of the storage medium,

encrypting data and keys stored by the TOE in order to prevent unauthorized 
access to this encrypted data.

			<description> It has to be assured that residual data that may remain at 
			a capture device after use cannot be used to gain access. </description> 
			<appnote> In some biometric technologies the capture device is responsible

			data. Because the capture device is not part of the TOE as specified in this
