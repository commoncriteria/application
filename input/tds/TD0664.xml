						<h:br/>All Other Platforms:
								The evaluator shall record the path of every file on the entire filesystem prior to 
								installation of the application, and then install and run the application. Afterwards, 
								the evaluator shall then uninstall the application, and compare the resulting filesystem
								to the initial record to verify that no files, other than configuration, output, and 
								audit/log files, have been added to the filesystem.
