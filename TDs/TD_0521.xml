              <Tests> 
                The tests described must be performed in conjunction with the other certificate services
                evaluation activities, including the functions in 
                <linkref linkend="FIA_X509_EXT.2.1">  </linkref>. The tests for the extendedKeyUsage rules are performed in conjunction with the uses that
                require those rules. If the application supports chains of length four or greater, the
                evaluator shall create a chain of at least four certificates: the node certificate to be
                tested, two Intermediate CAs, and the self-signed Root CA. If the application supports a
                maximum trust depth of two, then a chain with no Intermediate CA should instead be created. 
                <testlist> 
                  <test> 
                    The evaluator shall demonstrate that validating a certificate without a valid certification
                    path results in the function failing, for each of the following reasons, in turn:
<h:ul>
<h:li>
by establishing a certificate path in which one of the issuing certificates is not a CA certificate,
</h:li>
<h:li>
by omitting the basicConstraints field in one of the issuing certificates,
</h:li>
<h:li>
by setting the basicConstraints field in an issuing certificate to have CA=False,
</h:li>
<h:li>
by omitting the CA signing bit of the key usage field in an issuing certificate, and
</h:li>
<h:li>
by setting the path length field of a valid CA field to a value strictly less than the certificate path
</h:li>
<h:br></h:br>
The evaluator shall then establish a valid certificate path consisting of valid CA certificates, and demonstrate that the function succeeds. The evaluator shall then remove trust in one of the CA certificates, and show that the function fails.
                   </test>
                  <test> 
                    The evaluator shall demonstrate that validating an expired certificate results in the
                    function failing.

                  <test> 
                    The evaluator shall test that the 
                    <abbr linkend="TOE" title="Target of Evaluation"> TOE </abbr>
                    can properly handle revoked certificates-â€“conditional on whether CRL, OCSP, OCSP Stapling
                    or OCSP Multi-stapling is selected; if multiple methods are selected, then the following
                    tests shall be performed for each method: 
                    <h:ul> 
                      <h:li> 
                        The evaluator shall test revocation of the node certificate.
                       </h:li>
                      <h:li> 
                        The evaluator shall also test revocation of an intermediate CA certificate (i.e. the
                        intermediate CA certificate should be revoked by the root CA), if intermediate CA
                        certificates are supported. If OCSP stapling per RFC6066 is the only supported revocation
                        method, this test is omitted.
                       </h:li>
                     </h:ul>
                    The evaluator shall ensure that a valid certificate is used, and that the validation function
                    succeeds. The evaluator then attempts the test with a certificate that has been revoked (for
                    each method chosen in the selection) to ensure when the certificate is no longer valid that the
                    validation function fails.
                   </test>
                  <test> 
                    If any OCSP option is selected, the evaluator shall configure the OCSP server or use a man-in-the-middle
                    tool to present a certificate that does not have the OCSP signing purpose and verify that
                    validation of the OCSP response fails. If CRL is selected, the evaluator shall configure the CA
                    to sign a CRL with a certificate that does not have the cRLsign key usage bit set, and verify that
                    validation of the CRL fails.
                   </test>
                  <test> 
                    The evaluator shall modify any byte in the first eight bytes of the certificate and demonstrate
                    that the certificate fails to validate. (The certificate will fail to parse correctly.)
                   </test>
                  <test> 
                    The evaluator shall modify any byte in the last byte of the certificate and demonstrate that the
                    certificate fails to validate. (The signature on the certificate will not validate.)
                   </test>
                  <test> 
                    The evaluator shall modify any byte in the public key of the certificate and demonstrate that
                    the certificate fails to validate. (The signature on the certificate will not validate.)
                   </test>
<test>
Test 8a: (Conditional on support for EC certificates as indicated in FCS_COP.1(3)). The evaluator shall establish a valid, trusted certificate chain consisting of an EC leaf certificate, an EC Intermediate CA certificate not designated as a trust anchor, and an EC certificate designated as a trusted anchor, where the elliptic curve parameters are specified as a named curve. The evaluator shall confirm that the TOE validates the certificate chain.

Test 8b: (Conditional on support for EC certificates as indicated in FCS_COP.1(3)). The evaluator shall replace the intermediate certificate in the certificate chain for Test 8a with a modified certificate, where the modified intermediate CA has a public key information field where the EC parameters uses an explicit format version of the Elliptic Curve parameters in the public key information field of the intermediate CA certificate from Test 8a, and the modified Intermediate CA certificate is signed by the trusted EC root CA, but having no other changes. The evaluator shall confirm the TOE treats the certificate as invalid.
