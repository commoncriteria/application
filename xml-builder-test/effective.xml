	<sec:Introduction>
		<sec:Overview>&lt;p&gt;The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to describe the security
			functionality of application software in terms of &lt;xref g="CC"&gt;&lt;/xref&gt; and
			to define functional and assurance requirements for such software. In recent years,
			software attacks have shifted from targeting operating systems to targeting
			applications. This has been the natural response to improvements in operating system
			security and development processes. As a result, it is paramount that the security of
			applications be improved to reduce the risk of compromise.&lt;/p&gt;</sec:Overview>

		<section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">&lt;p&gt;The
			requirements in this document apply to application software which runs on any type of
			platform. Some application types are covered by more specific PPs, which may be
			expressed as PP-Modules of this PP. Such applications are subject to the requirements of
			both this PP and the PP-Module that addresses their special functionality. PPs for some
			particularly specialized applications may not be expressed as PP-Modules at this time,
			though the requirements in this document should be seen as objectives for those highly
			specialized applications. Although the requirements in this document apply to a wide
			range of application software, consult guidance from the relevant national schemes to
			determine when formal Common Criteria evaluation is expected for a particular type of
			application. This may vary depending upon the nature of the security functionality of
			the application. The application, which consists of the software provided by its vendor,
			is installed onto the platform(s) it operates on. It executes on the platform, which may
			be an operating system (), hardware environment, a software based execution environment,
			or some combination of these (). Those platforms may themselves run within other
			environments, such as virtual machines or operating systems, that completely abstract
			away the underlying hardware from the application. The TOE is not accountable for
			security functionality that is implemented by platform layers that are abstracted away.
			Some evaluation activities are specific to the particular platform on which the
			application runs, in order to provide precision and repeatability. The only platforms
			currently recognized by the AppPP are those specified in SFR Evaluation Activities. To
			test on a platform for which there are no EAs, a Vendor should contact NIAP with
			recommended EAs. NIAP will determine if the proposed platform is appropriate for the PP
			and accept, reject, or develop EAs as necessary in coordination with the technical
			community. Applications include a diverse range of software such as office suites, thin
			clients, PDF readers, downloadable smartphone apps, and apps running in a cloud
			container. The TOE includes any software in the application installation package, even
			those pieces that may extend or modify the functionality of the underlying platform,
			such as kernel drivers. Many platforms come bundled with applications such as web
			browsers, email clients and media players and these too should be considered subject to
			the requirements defined in this document although the expectation of formal Common
			Criteria evaluation depends upon the national scheme. BIOS and other firmware, the
			operating system kernel, and other systems software (and drivers) provided as part of
			the platform are outside the scope of this document.&lt;/p&gt;</section>

		<sec:Use_Cases> &lt;p&gt;Requirements in this Protection Profile are designed to address the
